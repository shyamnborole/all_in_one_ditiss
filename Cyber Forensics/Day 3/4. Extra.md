**1. What is the location of containers locally?**

- Containers are typically stored in the **/var/lib/docker** directory (on Linux systems) by default. However, the location can vary depending on the container runtime and configurations.

**2. What is the location of images locally?**

- Docker images are usually stored in the **/var/lib/docker/images** directory (on Linux systems) by default. Similar to containers, the location can vary based on the runtime and configurations.

**3. Are containers and images stored in one single file or different files?**

- Containers and images are stored in **multiple files**. Docker, for example, uses a layered approach to store images (each layer in a separate file) and containers typically consist of a configuration file and a container filesystem.

**4. What is TPM (Trusted Platform Module)? Where is it stored?**

- **TPM** is a hardware-based security module designed to securely store encryption keys, passwords, and other sensitive data. It is typically integrated into the motherboard of a computer or as a separate chip. The TPM module is stored in the **hardware** itself (i.e., on the system's motherboard).

**5. Why is the hash value generated in Linux and Windows different?**

- **Windows** and **Linux** use different line endings for text files:
    
    - **Windows** uses `\r\n` (Carriage Return + Line Feed).
    - **Linux** uses `\n` (Line Feed only).
    
    As a result, the file content appears different when read by different operating systems, leading to different hash values. For example, when generating a hash using `md5sum` on Linux, the result may differ from the hash generated by Windows tools due to the difference in line endings.

**Recommendation:**

- When dealing with hash calculations across different operating systems, it is recommended to use the same tool and ensure consistent line endings. Alternatively, use tools that normalize the line endings before calculating the hash (e.g., `dos2unix` for Linux).
