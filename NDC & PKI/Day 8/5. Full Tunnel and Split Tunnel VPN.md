### **1. Full Tunnel VPN**

In a **Full Tunnel VPN**, **all your internet traffic** is routed through the VPN server, regardless of which website, app, or service you use.

- **Encryption**: **All data** (e.g., websites, apps, or downloads) is **encrypted** and sent through the VPN tunnel.
- **Decryption**: The VPN server **decrypts** the data, sends it to its destination on the internet, and encrypts the response before sending it back to you.
- **Result**: **All traffic** is **fully protected** end-to-end.

#### **Example**

Imagine you are connected to a VPN while using a coffee shop's public Wi-Fi:

- You visit **Google**, **YouTube**, or access your **banking website**.
- With a **Full Tunnel VPN**, **all your traffic** (Google, YouTube, banking data, etc.) first goes to the **VPN server**, and then it reaches the final destination.

#### **Advantages**

- **Highly Secure**: Every bit of your traffic is protected.
- **Privacy Protection**: Hides your location, IP address, and activity completely.

#### **Disadvantages**

- **Slower Speeds**: Because all traffic, even non-sensitive activities (like browsing YouTube), must pass through the VPN.
- **Higher Load on VPN Server**: Can lead to performance issues.

### **2. Split Tunnel VPN**

Split tunneling means that some of your data is routed through an encrypted VPN connection while other apps and data have direct access to the Internet. It’s primarily relevant for remote access-type VPNs (like your work-from-home setup), where your computer is connected directly to a remote network at your office.

- **Encryption**: Only the data that goes through the **VPN tunnel** is encrypted.
- Other traffic (e.g., streaming YouTube) bypasses the VPN and remains unencrypted.
- **Decryption**: The VPN server decrypts only the selected traffic routed through the VPN.
- **Result**: **Partial Protection** – sensitive traffic is secure, but other data uses the normal internet.

#### **Example**

Imagine you are working remotely and connected to your company's VPN:

- You need to access **company files** (secured through the VPN).
- At the same time, you are watching **YouTube** or checking **personal email**.

With a **Split Tunnel VPN**:

- **Company files** go through the secure VPN tunnel.
- **YouTube** and **email** bypass the VPN and use the regular internet for faster access.

#### **Advantages**

- **Faster Speeds**: Only critical traffic goes through the VPN, leaving the rest on the normal internet.
- **Lower Load on VPN Server**: Improves overall performance for VPN users.
- **Efficient Use**: Ideal for activities where security isn’t needed, like streaming videos.

#### **Disadvantages**

- **Less Secure**: Non-VPN traffic remains unprotected and can expose your location or data.
- **Risk of Leaks**: Sensitive data could unintentionally bypass the VPN if not configured properly.
