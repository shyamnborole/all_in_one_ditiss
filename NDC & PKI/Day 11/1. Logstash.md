## **Logstash**

Logstash is a **server-side data processing pipeline**. It is a tool used to collect, process, and forward data. Logstash helps to extract data from various sources, transform it into a desired format, and then load it into a specific destination, such as a database or analytics tool.

### **Logstash Pipeline**

The Logstash pipeline operates based on the **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** model, which consists of three key stages:

#### 1. **Extract** (Input)

This stage is responsible for collecting data from various sources. The configuration for the input can include the following:

- **beats**: Collects data from lightweight shipping agents like Filebeat or Metricbeat.
- **file**: Reads data from local files.
- **http**: Accepts HTTP requests to receive data.
- **syslog**: Processes log messages using the syslog protocol.
- **stdin**: Captures input directly from the terminal.

#### 2. **Transform** (Filter)

In this stage, the data is transformed or modified as needed. The transformation stage is optional and depends on the use case. Some common filters include:

- **mutate**: Alters fields in the event (e.g., rename, add, remove, or update fields).
- **grok**: Parses unstructured data using regular expressions to extract meaningful information.
- **dns**: Resolves IP addresses to hostnames or vice versa.

#### 3. **Load** (Output)

This stage determines where the processed data should be sent. The following outputs are commonly used:

- **elasticsearch**: Sends data to Elasticsearch for storage and analysis.
- **stdout**: Outputs data to the terminal, useful for debugging.
- **syslog**: Forwards the processed data to a syslog server.
- **pager**: Sends notifications to pagers.
- **nagios**: Integrates with the Nagios monitoring tool.

### Key Note  

The **Transform (Filter)** stage is **optional**, meaning you can directly extract data and load it into the destination without applying any modifications or transformations.
