The **ISAKMP (Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol)** is a protocol used in the context of **IPSec** (Internet Protocol Security) to establish, manage, and terminate security associations (SAs). It provides the framework for negotiating cryptographic parameters and managing keys between two entities securely.

### Key Features of ISAKMP:

- **Negotiation of Security Associations (SAs):** It helps set up agreements on algorithms and keys for secure communication.
- **Framework for Key Exchange:** Works with key exchange protocols like IKE (Internet Key Exchange) to securely establish encryption and authentication keys.
- **Authentication and Integrity:** Ensures communication parties are authentic and that messages have not been tampered with.

### Relation to IPSec:

IPSec uses ISAKMP as part of its mechanism to securely transmit data over IP networks. Specifically, ISAKMP supports the exchange of cryptographic parameters that IPSec relies on for encryption, authentication, and integrity of the data packets.
