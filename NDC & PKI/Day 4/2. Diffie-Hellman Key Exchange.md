#### **Algorithm to Generate Symmetric Key at Both Ends**

The **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange** algorithm is commonly used to establish a shared symmetric key between two parties over an insecure channel. Here's how it works:

---
#### **Setup**

Imagine Tinku and Pinki want to securely exchange a symmetric key.

- Both agree on two public values:
    1. **Prime Number `p`**: 23
    2. **Base `g`**: 5

#### **Step 1: Secret Integers**

- Tinku selects a **private secret integer `a`**: 6
- Pinki selects a **private secret integer `b`**: 15

#### **Step 2: Compute Public Values**

- **Tinku calculates**:  
    `A = g ^ a mod  p`
    `A = 5 ^ 6 mod  23 = 8`
    
- **Pinki calculates**:  
    `B = g ^ b mod  p`
    `B = 5 ^ 15 mod  23 = 19`
    
#### **Step 3: Exchange Public Values**

- Tinku sends **A (8)** to Pinki.
- Pinki sends **B (19)** to Tinku.

#### **Step 4: Compute Shared Secret Key**

- **Tinku calculates the shared key `s`**:  
    `s = B ^ a mod  p`
    `s = 19 ^ 6 mod  23 = 2`
    
- **Pinki calculates the shared key `s`**:  
    `s = A ^ b mod  p`  
    `s = 8 ^ 15 mod  23 = 2`
    
#### **Result**

- Both Tinku and Pinki have independently computed the same shared symmetric key: **`2`**.
- This symmetric key can now be used for secure communication.

### **Key Points**

1. **Confidentiality**: The secret integers (`a` and `b`) are never transmitted, ensuring that the shared key is secure.
2. **Shared Key**: The same symmetric key (`2` in this example) is derived independently by both parties.
3. **Scalability**: This method allows secure key exchanges without requiring prior secure communication.
