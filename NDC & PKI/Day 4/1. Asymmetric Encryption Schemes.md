#### **Rule:**

1. Every participant has **two keys**:
    - **Public Key**: Shared with everyone.
    - **Private Key**: Kept secret and confidential.
2. Key properties:
    - A public key and private key form a **pair** and are mathematically related.
    - **Private keys cannot be derived** from public keys (ensuring security).
    - However, a **public key is derived from its corresponding private key**.
3. Both keys can be used for encryption and decryption, but:
    - Data encrypted with the **public key** must be decrypted using the **private key**.
    - Data encrypted with the **private key** must be decrypted using the **public key**.

### **Understanding Through an Example:**

Imagine three people: **Tinku**, **Pinki**, and **Gabbar**.

- **Tinku** and **Pinki** are communicating with each other.
- **Gabbar** is an attacker trying to intercept or interfere.

Each person has:

- A **private key** (kept secret).
- A **public key** (shared openly).

---

### **Scenarios:**

#### **1. Encrypting Data for Personal Use**

- **Example**: Tinku wants to secure a file on his system.
- Process:
    - Tinku encrypts the data using his **public key**.
    - Only Tinku can decrypt it using his **private key**.
- **Key Point**: Ensures confidentiality for personal data.

---

#### **2. Authenticating the Sender**

- **Example**: Tinku wants to prove his identity to Pinki.
- Process:
    - Tinku encrypts the data using his **private key**.
    - Anyone with Tinku’s **public key** can decrypt it.
- **Key Point**: This proves that Tinku sent the data, ensuring authenticity.
- **Use Case**: Applications where data integrity and authenticity are crucial, e.g., election results.

---

#### **3. Ensuring Confidentiality Without Authentication**

- **Example**: Tinku wants to send confidential data to Pinki.
- Process:
    - Tinku encrypts the data using **Pinki’s public key**.
    - Only Pinki can decrypt it using her **private key**.
- **Caveat**: Gabbar, who also has Pinki’s public key, could send encrypted data to Pinki.
    - Pinki cannot verify if the data is from Tinku or Gabbar.
- **Key Point**: Ensures confidentiality but lacks authentication.

### **Message Formats**

1. **Secure Message Format**:
    - The message is encrypted using the **receiver’s public key**.
2. **Open Message Format**:
    - The message is encrypted using the **sender’s private key**.

---

### **Advantages of Asymmetric Encryption**

- **Better key distribution**: No need to share secret keys.
- **Scalability**: Works well in large systems.
- **Authentication & Non-repudiation**: Ensures data authenticity and prevents denial of origin.

---

### **Disadvantages of Asymmetric Encryption**

- Slower compared to symmetric encryption.

---

### **Examples of Asymmetric Encryption Algorithms**

- RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)
- ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem)
- Diffie-Hellman
- El-Gamal
- DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)
- Knapsack
