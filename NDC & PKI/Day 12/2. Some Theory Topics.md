### **International Cryptography Restrictions**

- Different countries impose restrictions on the import and use of cryptography.
- Imported cryptographic systems may include backdoors for government access or require user registration.
- The goal of these restrictions varies, from national security to monitoring citizens' communications.

### **Introduction to Aadhaar and e-Sign**

- **Aadhaar Number**: A unique 12-digit identification number issued by the Government of India.
- **e-Sign**:
    - A digital signature service provided by the government.
    - Enables Aadhaar cardholders to electronically sign documents quickly and securely.
    - It adheres to IT Act, 2000 for legal validity.
- Aadhaar serves as proof of identity and address, widely used for authentication in digital services.

### **Public Key Cryptography Standards (PKCS)**

- A collection of standards for public-key cryptography developed by RSA Security LLC.
- **Total Standards**: 15 (PKCS #1 to PKCS #15).
- Examples include:
    - **PKCS #1**: RSA Cryptography Standard.
    - **PKCS #12**: Personal Information Exchange Syntax.
- **For more details:** [PKCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS).

### **FIPS 140-2**

- **Full Form**: Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 140-2.
- **Purpose**:
    - A U.S. government standard for validating cryptographic modules.
    - Specifies security requirements that cryptographic modules must meet to ensure reliable data protection.
- Used widely in government and industry for secure applications.
- **For details:** [FIPS 140-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-2).

### **SSL/TLS**

- **SSL (Secure Socket Layer)**: Older version of TLS.
- **TLS (Transport Layer Security)**: Modern and more secure version of SSL.
- Used to establish secure communication between servers and clients (e.g., HTTPS).
- **Key Difference**: TLS offers stronger encryption and improved security protocols over SSL.

### **S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions)**

It is a protocol. Specifically, it is a standard used to secure email communications. It ensures that emails can be encrypted for privacy and can include digital signatures for authentication, verifying that the email comes from a legitimate sender and hasn't been tampered with.

1. **Supported Document Types**: S/MIME specifies and standardizes the document formats that can be used in web services and email communication, ensuring compatibility.
2. **Encryption**: S/MIME provides encryption capabilities to protect the contents of email messages. This means the email's content is transformed into unreadable text, which only the intended recipient can decrypt and read.
3. **Digital Signatures**: S/MIME offers digital signature functionality, which adds a unique cryptographic signature to emails. This ensures that the email is from the claimed sender and has not been modified in transit, providing authentication and integrity.

In essence, S/MIME is used to ensure emails are secure, private, and can be trusted, by encrypting the content and using digital signatures to verify authenticity.

### **Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)**

- A widely used data encryption and decryption program.
- Based on the **OpenPGP Standard (RFC 4880)**.
- Ensures secure email communication and file encryption.

---

### **ip6tables**

- Similar to `iptables`, but specifically for IPv6.
- Functionality and usage remain the same as `iptables` (which is for IPv4).
- Used for configuring network packet filtering and NAT rules in IPv6 networks.
