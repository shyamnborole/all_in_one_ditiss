**Blockchain** is like a chain made of blocks. Each block holds some information, and the blocks are connected in a sequence. You can store anything inside these blocks (like data, records, or transactions). The key thing about blockchain is its **integrity**, which means that once something is stored, it’s almost impossible to change it. This makes it secure and reliable.

The main building block of blockchain is something called a **Hashing Algorithm**. This is a special way of turning data into a fixed-length value, which helps in linking blocks together securely.

A block contains the following:

1. **Block Number**: Every block has a number that shows its position in the blockchain.
2. **Data**: This is the actual information that you want to store.
3. **Previous Hash**: Each block remembers the "hash" of the previous block. This links the blocks together like a chain.
4. **Date/Time**: The exact moment the block was created.
5. **Nonce**: A random value added to the block to ensure that the block’s hash is unique.
6. **Hash**: A unique identifier (like a digital fingerprint) for the current block. It’s created using the data inside the block and the previous hash.

The **first block** in a blockchain is called the **Genesis Block**. Since it’s the starting point, it doesn’t have a previous block, so its **previous hash** is set to zero.

### **Nonce:**

A **nonce** is a random value that is used in blockchain mining to help generate a valid hash for the block. It ensures that the hash of the block is unique and can’t be easily guessed or reproduced. The nonce plays a critical role in making blockchain secure.
