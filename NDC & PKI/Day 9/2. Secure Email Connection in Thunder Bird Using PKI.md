## **Task: Secure Email Communication**

**Objective:** Create certificates for each user, bind them to private keys, and configure secure email communication.

### **Naming Conventions**

#### User `userone`

1. **004-001-DB-one.xdb** – Database for `userone`.
2. **004-003-CSR-one.pem** – Certificate Signing Request.
3. **004-003-CRT-one.crt** – Certificate.
4. **004-004-CRT_CHAIN_KEY-one.pfx** – Certificate + Private Key.

#### User `usertwo`

1. **005-001-DB-two.xdb** – Database for `usertwo`.
2. **005-003-CSR-two.pem** – Certificate Signing Request.
3. **005-003-CRT-two.crt** – Certificate.
4. **005-004-CRT_CHAIN_KEY-two.pfx** – Certificate + Private Key.

## **Steps**

### **1. Create Private Keys**

- Generate private keys for both `userone` and `usertwo` in their respective databases.

---

### **2. Configure Certificates for `userone`**

1. Create a certificate in `userone`:
    
    - Enter **Common Name**: `userone@shuharilabs.local`.
    - Enter **Email**: `userone@shuharilabs.local`.
    - Click **OK** and export the certificate to the `userone` folder.
2. Go to **Sub CA**:
    
    - Import the CSR from `userone`.
    - Create a new certificate:
        - Verify details under **Subject**.
        - Go to **Extensions**:
            - Add the email to the certificate. You should see a green tick confirming the email.
        - Configure **Key Usage**:
            - Select: `Digital Signature`, `Non-Repudiation`, `Key Encipherment`, `Data Encipherment`.
        - Configure **Critical Section**:
            - Select: `E-mail Protection`.
        - Double-check settings in the **Advanced Tab**.
        - Click **OK**.
3. Export the certificate with the appropriate name to the `userone` folder.
    
4. Go back to the `userone` database:
    
    - Import certificates from **Root CA** and **Sub CA**.
5. Export the final certificate:
    
    - Bind the private key with the `.pfx` extension.
    - Save it in the `userone` folder.

### **3. Configure Certificates for `usertwo`**

Repeat the same steps for `usertwo` as above.

### **4. Configure Thunderbird for Secure Email**

1. **Import Certificates**:
    
    - **Root CA Certificate**:
        - Go to **Settings -> Account Settings -> End-to-End Encryption -> Manage S/MIME Certificates -> Authorities -> Import**.
        - Select the Root CA certificate, check both checkboxes, and click **OK**.
    - **User Certificates**:

#### Digitally Signed Email

1. Send an email from `userone` to `usertwo`:
    - Select **S/MIME -> Digitally Sign**.
    - Send the email.
2. Open the email in `usertwo`:
    - Verify that the email is signed, ensuring **Authentication and Integrity**.

#### Digitally Signed and Encrypted Email
