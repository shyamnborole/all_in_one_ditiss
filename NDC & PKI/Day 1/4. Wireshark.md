- **Creator:** Gerald Combs.
- **Previous Name:** Ethereal (older version of Wireshark).
- **Purpose:** A packet capturing and analyzing tool.

### **How Wireshark Works**

- Wireshark cannot operate on its own; it requires **libraries** like `npcap` to function.

## **What is a Library in Computer Science?**

- A library adds functionalities to your main module or application.
    - **Example:** Installing different apps on your phone adds specific features to the device.
    - **Examples of Libraries:**
        - **C Headers:** Extend the functionality of a C program.
        - **Python Modules:** Provide additional features like math operations, networking, etc.

## **Packet Capturing Libraries (pcap)**

Packet capturing requires libraries, specific to the platform:

| Type     | Libraries          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| General  | `pcap`             |
| Windows  | `winpcap`, `npcap` |
| Linux    | `libpcap`          |
| Wireless | `airpcap`          |

- Without `npcap`, Wireshark won’t display any options in the dashboard.

## **What is an Interface?**

- An **interface** enables communication between two different zones or namespaces.
    - **Example:** Connecting a computer to a network.
- Selecting the correct interface is critical for capturing the right traffic in Wireshark.

## **Wireshark Interface Layout**

When capturing packets in Wireshark, you will see three primary windows:

1. **Packet List Window:** Displays the list of captured packets.
2. **Packet Details Window:** Shows detailed information for a selected packet.
3. **Packet Bytes Window:** Displays the raw data of the packet in hexadecimal format.

## **Packet Filtering in Wireshark**

Wireshark provides two types of filters:

1. **Capture Filter:** Filters traffic during the capturing process. Only the specified traffic is captured.
    - Example: Capture only TCP traffic using `tcp`.
2. **Display Filter:** Captures all traffic but displays only what you want to see.
    - Example: Show only HTTP traffic using `http`.

## **tcpdump**

- **Overview:** tcpdump is the predecessor of Wireshark, often referred to as the "father" of Wireshark.
- **Purpose:** Packet capturing tool, similar to Wireshark but without a GUI (command-line-based).
- **Significance:** It is considered the first **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**.
