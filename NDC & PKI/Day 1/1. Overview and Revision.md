## **What Happens When You Browse the Internet?**

1. **Visibility on the Internet:**
    - Your actions online are visible to everyone, including potential attackers.
    - **Bots vs. Humans:**
        - A significant portion of internet traffic is generated by bots, not humans.
2. **Bot Statistics (2017):**
    - 48.2% of traffic: Human activity.
    - 51.8% of traffic: Bots.
    - This highlights that the internet is dominated by automated programs.
3. **Protection Perspective:**
