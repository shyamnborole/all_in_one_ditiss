### **1. ASCII**

- **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)** is a character encoding standard used for representing text in computers. It encodes 128 characters, including:
    - English letters (A-Z, a-z)
    - Digits (0-9)
    - Punctuation marks and control characters.

### **2. Coding and Decoding**

- **Coding** is the process of converting data or information into a specific format.
- **Decoding** is the process of converting the encoded data back into its original format.

### **3. Interview Question: What is the Difference Between Hashing and Encryption?**

- **Hashing:**
    - A one-way process that converts data into a fixed-length hash value (usually a checksum or fingerprint).
    - It is irreversible, meaning once data is hashed, it cannot be turned back to the original form.
    - Used for data integrity checks (e.g., storing passwords securely).
    - Example: **SHA-256**, **MD5**.
- **Encryption:**
    - A two-way process used to secure data by converting it into a form that can only be read by someone with the decryption key.
    - It is reversible, meaning data can be decrypted back to its original form using the proper key.
    - Used for confidentiality (e.g., encrypting files or communication).
    - Example: **AES**, **RSA**.

### **4. Apache Folder Structure for Websites**

- **`sites-available` Folder:**
    
    - This folder contains the configuration files for all websites on the server.
    - Each website’s configuration should be present here, but the website is **not active** until it's linked to `sites-enabled`.
- **`sites-enabled` Folder:**
    
    - This folder contains **active website configurations**.
    - If you want a website to be live, create a **soft link** to its configuration file from `sites-available` to `sites-enabled`.
    
    **Command to create a soft link:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/your_site.conf /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
    ```

### **5. Apache User: `www-data`**

- In **Debian-based** systems (like Ubuntu), the `www-data` user is automatically created when you install and run the **Apache2** service.
    - This user is responsible for running Apache web server processes and managing web content.
- In **RedHat-based** systems (like Fedora), the `apache` user is automatically created when you install and run the **httpd** service.
	- This user is responsible for running Apache web server processes and managing web content.

### **6. Nagios Modes**

- Nagios has different **modes** or **states** that it operates in:
    - **Monitoring Mode**: Where Nagios checks the health and status of servers, applications, and services.
    - **Command Mode**: Allows Nagios to execute commands for monitoring and triggering actions like restarting services.
    - **Web Interface Mode**: Through the Nagios web UI, users can view the status of monitored hosts and services and configure Nagios.

### **7. Why are the `rewrite` and `cgi` Modules of Apache2 Required for Nagios?**

- **`rewrite` Module:**
    - The `rewrite` module is necessary for **URL rewriting**. This allows Nagios to provide a cleaner, user-friendly URL structure in the web interface. It also enables redirecting URLs and handling complex URL patterns.
- **`cgi` Module:**
    - The **CGI (Common Gateway Interface)** module is required to execute scripts, such as those used by Nagios, through Apache.
    - This allows Nagios to run dynamic content and interact with server-side processes, such as generating reports or running commands based on monitored data.

Both of these modules ensure that Nagios functions correctly by enabling proper URL handling and dynamic content execution.

### **8. Few Useful Commands**

- **`scp`**:  
    Securely copy files between systems over SSH.  
    **Format**:
    
    ```bash
    scp [options] source_file user@destination_host:path
    ```
    
    Example:
    
    ```bash
    scp file.txt user@192.168.1.1:/home/user/
    ```
    
- **`wget`**:  
    Download files from the internet via HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP.  
    **Format**:
    
    ```bash
    wget [options] URL
    ```
    
    Example:
    
    ```bash
    wget https://example.com/file.zip
    ```
