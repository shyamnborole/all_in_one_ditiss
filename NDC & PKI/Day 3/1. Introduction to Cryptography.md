### **Introduction to PKI**

**Why is PKI included in the syllabus?** 
PKI (Public Key Cryptography Infrastructure) is crucial for two main reasons:

1. **Secure Communication and Storage:** How can computers securely communicate and store data?
2. **Trust Building:** Computers operate based on trust. So, how can trust be established between different computers?

PKI is called an "infrastructure" because it involves a collection of entities, not just a single one.

### **Cryptography Overview**

Cryptography is essentially about **hiding data**.

**Definition:**  
It refers to methods of storing and transmitting data in a form that only authorized users can read and process. Various algorithms are used for this purpose.

There are two types of data:

1. **Data in Transit**
2. **Data at Rest**

Cryptography is aimed at protecting both types of data.

**Goals of Cryptography:**

- **Make attacks more difficult** for the attacker.
- **Make it practically impossible** for an attacker to break the code.

**Note:**  
While cryptography can significantly enhance security, **no system is 100% secure.** Every lock or computer system can potentially be broken.

### **Key Terms in Cryptography**

- **Plaintext:** The original, readable data before encryption.
    
- **Access Control:** Techniques used to restrict access to certain resources (e.g., username and password).
    
- **Encryption:** The process of converting plaintext into ciphertext (a non-human-readable format).
    
- **Decryption:** The reverse of encryption; converting ciphertext back into plaintext.
    
- **Cryptanalysis:** The study of breaking encryption methods.
    
- **Cryptology:** The study of both cryptanalysis and cryptography.
    
- **Encryption Algorithm:** A set of complex mathematical rules used to encrypt data.
    
- **Encipher:** Another term for encryption; converting plaintext into ciphertext.
    
- **Decipher:** Another term for decryption; converting ciphertext back into plaintext.
    
- **Receipt:** An acknowledgment that a process has been completed.
    

**Note:**

- **Hashing** is a one-way function (you can’t reverse it).
- **Encryption** is a two-way function (you can encrypt and decrypt).

### **Interesting Point:**

Courses at CDAC are designed to help you **build** secure systems, while in PG DITISS, you learn to **break** systems to understand how they can be attacked or compromised.
