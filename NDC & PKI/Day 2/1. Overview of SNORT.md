### **Introduction to Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**

- An **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** monitors network traffic and allows only authorized packets into the system.
- The definition of intrusion varies across organizations and is determined by their respective policies.
- **Authorized** and **unauthorized** traffic is also defined by the organization's specific rules.

### **What is SNORT?**

- SNORT is an **Open Source Intrusion Detection System**.
- It can operate in multiple modes:
    - **Packet Capturing or Sniffing Mode**: Used to verify SNORT's installation and functionality.
    - **NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System) Mode**: For detecting intrusions and analyzing network traffic.
    - **Packet Logging Mode**: Logs network packets to a disk for later analysis.

### **Installation Steps**

1. **Install Winpcap**
    
    - Download and install **Winpcap**, a library required for SNORT to capture network packets.
2. **Verify Winpcap Installation**
    
    - Open the **Add or Remove Programs** section in Windows to ensure Winpcap is installed successfully.
3. **Install SNORT**
    
    - Download and install SNORT in the `C:\` folder (recommended for easier setup).
4. **Add SNORT to Defender Exclusion List**
    
    - Add the **SNORT folder** (`C:\Snort`) to the Windows Defender exclusion list to prevent interference.
5. **Ensure 7-Zip is Installed**
    
    - Install **7-Zip**, which will be used to extract rule files.
6. **Extract Rule Files**
    
    - Navigate to the folder containing `snortrules-snapshot-2923.tar.gz`.
        - Right-click and choose `7-Zip > Extract Here`.
        - If the `7-Zip` option isn’t visible, select **More Options** after right-clicking.
    - After extraction, right-click the `.tar` file and choose `7-Zip > Extract Files`.
        - Set `C:\Snort` as the destination folder.
        - In the options, select **Overwrite without prompt** and uncheck any checkboxes.
7. **Open Command Prompt and Configure SNORT**
    
    - Open **Command Prompt** as an administrator and navigate to `C:\Snort\bin`:
        
	```shell
		cd C:\Snort\bin
	```
        
8. **Verify SNORT Installation**
	- Run the following command to list available network interfaces, confirming SNORT is installed correctly.
	```shell
		snort -W
	```


Address any errors shown during the setup and apply the extra changes suggested in the error logs. The steps to resolve those errors are given below.

### **Key Commands and Usage**

#### **Running SNORT**

- Always run SNORT as an **administrator**. (Run `cmd` as administrator and navigate to the `C:\Snort\bin`) then start using the `snort` commands:
- Default SNORT executable path:
    
    ```plaintext
    C:\Snort\bin\snort.exe
    ```
    
#### **List Network Interfaces**

- Use the following command to list interfaces supported by SNORT:
    
    ```shell
    snort -W
    ```
    
- Use this along with:
    
    ```shell
    getmac /fo csv /v
    ```
    
    This retrieves MAC addresses of network adapters, helping identify the correct interface.

#### **Capture Packets**

- To select a specific interface (e.g., interface 4):
    
    ```shell
    snort -i 4
    ```
    
- Stop packet capturing:
    - Press `CTRL + C`.

#### **Additional Flags**

- To see **application layer data**:
    
    ```shell
    snort -i 4 -d
    ```
    
- To see **data link layer data**:
    
    ```shell
    snort -i 4 -e
    ```
    
- For **verbose output**:
    
    ```shell
    snort -i 4 -v
    ```

### **Rules in SNORT**

- SNORT uses **rules** to detect known threats, similar to how antivirus software uses signature files.
- Initially, the **rules folder** is empty.
- You can:
    - Download pre-defined rule files from SNORT developers.
    - Create custom rule files tailored to specific needs.

#### **Important Note**

- Add SNORT rule files to the **Windows Defender exclusion list** to avoid interference.

#### **`browser-ie.rules` File**

- This file contains rules related to Internet Explorer vulnerabilities. This file is automatically deleted if you do not add the `Snort` folder to the exclusion list of Windows Defender.
