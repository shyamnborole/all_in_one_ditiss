### **Telnet Between Routers**:

- **`A#telnet 172.16.20.2`**: This command will telnet from **Router A** to **Router B**.
- Once connected to **Router B**:
    - **`B> enable`**: Switch to privileged EXEC mode on **Router B**.
    - **`B#telnet 172.16.40.2`**: This will telnet from **Router B** to **Router C**.
- Once connected to **Router C**:
    - **`C> enable`**: Switch to privileged EXEC mode on **Router C**.

**Note**: In a single CLI window, you can have multiple active telnet sessions (e.g., from Router A to Router B, and then from Router B to Router C). Technically, three separate telnet sessions are running.

### **Managing Multiple Telnet Sessions**:

- **Switching Between Telnet Sessions**:  
    Use `Shift + Ctrl + 6`, then press `x`. This will return you to the previous router without closing the current telnet session.
    
- **`C#show sessions`**:  
    Displays all active telnet sessions. The current session will be marked with an asterisk (*).
    
- **`C#1`**:  
    This command lets you switch to **session 1** from any other session. If you are currently in session 2, this command will take you back to session 1.
    
- **`C#disconnect 2`**:  
    Disconnects session number 2.

### **Managing Users and Lines**:

- **`C#show users`**:  
    Displays a list of users currently logged into the router.
    
- **`C#clear line 1`**:  
    Disconnects a user on **line 1** (e.g., another administrator using telnet).
---
### **Telnet Limitations**:

- **Simultaneous Telnet Connections**:  
    Up to **7 administrators** can telnet into a Cisco router simultaneously.
---
### **Telnet Shortcut**:

- You can simply type the IP address (e.g., `A# 172.16.20.2`) to initiate a telnet session by default because the router assumes telnet unless otherwise specified.
