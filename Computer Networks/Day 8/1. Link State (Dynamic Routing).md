Metric is nothing but distance.
The path with lesser cost is chosen.
We still use RIP since it is simple to implement.

### **Three Types of Link-State Packets**

1. **Hello Packet**:
    
    - Purpose: Used to establish and maintain neighbor relationships between routers.
    - Sent at regular intervals: Every **10 seconds** for links with speeds greater than **1.544 Mbps**, or every **30 seconds** for links with speeds less than **1.544 Mbps**.
2. **LSA (Link-State Advertisement)**:
    
    - Purpose: Sends updates about changes in the network, particularly concerning unreachable or faulty networks.
    - Key Point: It only carries information about **network changes**, not the entire routing table, making it more efficient.
3. **DD (Database Description)**:
    
    - Purpose: Provides a summary of the router's routing table.
    - Sent every **30 minutes** to synchronize routing information between routers, ensuring they have consistent data.

## **Routing Rumors**
**Routing rumors** refer to incorrect or outdated routing information that spreads through a network due to dynamic changes, delays in updates, or temporary inconsistencies in routing protocols.
### Example:

In **distance-vector routing**, such as RIP (Routing Information Protocol), routers exchange routing tables with neighbors. If one router has outdated information, it might propagate this incorrect route as a valid path.
#### Scenario:
- **Router A** learns from **Router B** that a certain network is reachable through **Router C**.
- However, **Router C** may have lost its connection to the network but hasn't yet notified **Router B**.
- **Router A** continues to propagate this incorrect route, creating a "routing rumor."

These rumors can cause temporary routing loops or inefficient paths until the network stabilizes and the routing protocol updates are synchronized.

- **Routing Table**:
    - **Definition**: A table in a router that stores the best routes (paths) to various network destinations.
    - **Contents**: Destination networks, next-hop addresses, and metrics (e.g., distance or cost).
    - **Purpose**: Used to determine the best path for forwarding packets.

- **Link State Table**:
    - **Definition**: A table that contains detailed information about all the routers and their connected links within the network.
    - **Contents**: Link states, network topology data, and cost metrics.
    - **Purpose**: Used by link-state protocols (e.g., OSPF) to calculate the shortest path using algorithms like Dijkstra's.

- **Neighbor Table**:
    - **Definition**: A table that lists all the neighboring routers directly connected to a router.
    - **Contents**: Neighbor router IDs, interface information, and status.
    - **Purpose**: Maintains information about directly connected routers for establishing routing updates and adjacencies.
