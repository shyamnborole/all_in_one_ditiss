Switching refers to the process of forwarding data packets from one device to another within the same network. A switch uses MAC (Media Access Control) addresses to direct the data frames to the correct destination port. It operates at Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) of the OSI model.

### **Store-and-Forward Switching**:

- **How it works**: The switch receives the entire data frame (i.e., 1518 bytes), checks it for errors using CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check), and then forwards it if no errors are detected.
- **Pros**: More reliable as it checks for errors.
- **Cons**: Higher latency, as the entire frame must be received before forwarding.

### **Cut-Through Switching**:

- **How it works**: The switch reads only the destination MAC address from the frame(i.e., 6 Bytes) and forwards it immediately without waiting for the entire frame.
- **Pros**: Lower latency since it starts forwarding earlier.
- **Cons**: Less reliable, as it forwards corrupted frames since no error-checking occurs.

### **Modified Cut-Through**

- **How it works**: Combines elements of both store-and-forward and cut-through. The switch may perform a minimal check (e.g., reading the first 64 bytes) to ensure that the frame is not corrupt before forwarding it.
- **Pros**: Balances speed and reliability, offering lower latency than store-and-forward while still providing some error checking.
- **Cons**: Slightly more complex implementation compared to pure cut-through.

These mechanisms help determine how switches manage data traffic and influence network performance.

**Note:** **Latency** depends on frame size.

#### **When a frame is received:**

- If the destination MAC address is a **broadcast address**, the switch will flood the frame to all its ports.
- If the destination MAC address is **unknown**, the switch will also flood the frame to all ports.
- If the destination MAC address is **recognized / known**, the switch will forward the frame only to the specific port associated with that address.
