**1. Site-Local Addresses (FECO::/10):**

- **Definition:** Site-local addresses are used within a single site or organization and are not routable on the global Internet. They are intended for local communications.
- **Range:** Addresses that start with the prefix `FEC0::/10`.
- **Example:** `FEC0:1234:5678:9ABC::1`  
    This address can be used for communication between devices within the same site but cannot be accessed from outside.

**2. Link-Local Addresses (FE80::/10):**

- **Definition:** Link-local addresses are used for communication between nodes on the same local link (network segment). They are automatically configured and do not require a router.
- **Range:** Addresses that start with the prefix `FE80::/10`, typically followed by zeros to complete the 128-bit address.
- **Example:** `FE80::1A2B:3C4D:5E6F`  
    This address is used for local communication within a network segment and is not routable beyond that segment.

### Summary

- **Site-local addresses** are for communications within an organization and are not globally routable (e.g., `FEC0:1234:5678:9ABC::1`).
- **Link-local addresses** are for communication between devices on the same local link and are automatically configured (e.g., `FE80::1A2B:3C4D:5E6F`).
