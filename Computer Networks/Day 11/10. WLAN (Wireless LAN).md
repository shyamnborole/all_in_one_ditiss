### WLAN Overview
A **Wireless LAN (WLAN)** is a local area network that uses wireless communication (like Wi-Fi) to connect devices within a limited area, such as a home, office, or campus, enabling data transfer without physical cables.

1. **Media: Radio Frequency**  
    WLAN uses radio frequency for communication, similar to wired connections but without physical cables.
    
2. **Frequency Bands:**
    
    - **2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz**: These are the public frequency bands used for WLAN; other bands are reserved for military use.
3. **802.11 Standards:**
    
    - **802.11b (2.4 GHz)**: Up to 11 Mbps; offers longer range due to lower frequency.
    - **802.11g (2.4 GHz)**: Up to 56 Mbps; also provides good range.
    - **802.11n (5.0 GHz)**: 150-300 Mbps; suitable for IoT devices but has a shorter range (around 10 meters with obstacles).
    - **802.11a/b**: Backward compatible with earlier standards.
4. **Range Considerations:**  
    No fixed distance for WLAN coverage; range can be affected by obstacles like wood and glass, which significantly reduce signal strength.
    
5. **SSID and Channel:**
    
    - **SSID(Service Set Identifier)**: Example name (e.g., "Sunbeam").
    - **Channel**: Set to auto (1-15).
6. **Modes of Operation:**
    
    - **Ad-Hoc (IBSS)**: Direct device-to-device communication without a central access point.
    - **Infrastructure Mode**: Connects wireless devices to a wired network via an Access Point (AP), functioning like a hub. These are the ones that are used these days.
      Though, we can configure mode back to Ad-Hoc.
7. **Network Types:**
    
    - **IBSS (Independent Basic Service Set)**: Peer-to-peer network without an AP.
    - **BSS (Basic Service Set)**: A BSS consists of a single Access Point and all the devices (stations) connected to it. The AP facilitates communication within the network and connects the wireless devices to the wired network.
    - **ESS (Extended Service Set)**: An ESS is made up of multiple BSSs that are interconnected through a wired network. Each BSS has its own AP, allowing devices to roam between different BSSs while maintaining connectivity. The APs work together to provide a seamless network experience.

### **Precautions for ESS Implementation**

When implementing an ESS to avoid frame duplication and ensure optimal performance, consider the following:

1. **Channel Selection**:  
    Use non-overlapping channels for your APs. In the 2.4 GHz band, channels 1, 6, and 11 are recommended because they do not overlap, minimizing interference and potential frame duplication.
    
2. **Wireless LAN Controller (WLC)**:  
    Implement a Wireless LAN Controller to manage multiple APs. The WLC helps in coordinating channel assignments and power levels across APs, preventing overlapping coverage areas and ensuring efficient resource management.
    
3. **SSID Configuration**:  
    Ensure all APs in the ESS use the same SSID, which helps devices seamlessly roam between APs without connection interruptions.
    
4. **Proper Placement of APs**:  
    Strategically place APs to provide adequate coverage while avoiding signal overlap that could lead to interference and frame duplication.
    
5. **Monitor and Adjust**:  
    Continuously monitor the network for performance issues and adjust channel assignments and AP placements as necessary to optimize the network.
