**Definition:** Dynamic NAT with overload, also known as **Port Address Translation (PAT)**, allows multiple internal IP addresses to share a single public IP address by differentiating connections using port numbers.

#### **How It Works?**

1. **Translation Table:** NAT maintains a translation table that maps internal IP addresses and ports to a single public IP and unique port numbers.
2. **Outgoing Connections:** When an internal device initiates a connection, NAT translates the internal IP and port to the public IP and a unique port.
3. **Incoming Responses:** Responses to the public IP and port are translated back to the original internal IP and port using the translation table.

#### **Example**

In this example, two internal devices (172.16.10.2 and 172.16.10.3) are using a single public IP address (202.208.220.1) to access an external server (75.1.1.1).

- **172.16.10.2** initiates a connection using port 2000. NAT translates this to the public IP with port 3000.
- **172.16.10.3** connects using port 2001, which NAT translates to the same public IP but with port 3001.

The NAT device keeps a translation table to manage these connections, allowing both internal devices to communicate externally without IP address conflicts. This method enables efficient usage of public IPs while supporting multiple simultaneous connections.

- **Internal Devices:**
    - 172.16.10.2 uses port 2000 → 202.208.220.1 (public IP) with port 3000
    - 172.16.10.3 uses port 2001 → 202.208.220.1 with port 3001
	
- **Connections:**
    - 172.16.10.2:2000 → 202.208.220.1:3000 → 75.1.1.1
    - 172.16.10.3:2001 → 202.208.220.1:3001 → 75.1.1.1
    
- **Scalability:** Up to 65,535 internal devices can use the same public IP through different port numbers.
    

This allows efficient use of a limited number of public IP addresses while supporting many devices.

**`A(config)#ip nat inside source list 15 pool sunbeam overload`**: this command sets up dynamic NAT with overload, allowing internal devices matching access list 15 to use the IPs in the "sunbeam" pool for external communication.
`overload` keyword is added here.

#### **For single IP NAT Configuration**

- **Access List Configuration:**
    - **`access-list 50 permit 172.16.10.0 0.0.0.255`**  
        Creates an access list (50) that permits traffic from the internal network (172.16.10.0/24) for NAT translation.
		
- **NAT Pool Definition:**
    - **`ip nat pool cdac 202.208.220.1 202.208.220.1 netmask 255.255.255.0`**  
        Defines a NAT pool named "cdac" with a single public IP address (202.208.220.1) and its subnet mask.
		
- **NAT Configuration:**
    - **`ip nat inside source list 50 pool cdac overload`**  
        Configures NAT to use the defined pool for the internal IPs specified in access list 50, allowing multiple internal addresses to share the single public IP.
		
    - **Alternative Command:**
		
    - **`ip nat inside source list 50 int g0/1 overload`**  
        Instead of using a pool, this command translates addresses using the public IP of interface `g0/1`, also supporting overload.

#### **Monitoring Command**

`A#show ip nat translations`: This command displays the current NAT translation table, showing how internal IP addresses are mapped to external IP addresses and port numbers.
