* Protocol that is used to map the MAC addresses to the IP addresses.
* **ARP** helps machines communicate by broadcasting a request for a specific device's MAC address.
* **ARP Cache Time**: MAC addresses are typically stored for a period after communication, allowing faster reconnections. The exact time can vary depending on the operating system and network configuration.

## MAC Addresses and MAC Table
* **MAC Table**: Switches learn MAC addresses through broadcasts and store them for efficient communication.
* **Collision Handling**: Switches reduce collisions by using RAM to queue data when multiple devices communicate simultaneously.
