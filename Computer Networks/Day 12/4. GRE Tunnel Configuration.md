### **Network Topology Overview**

- **Router A (LAN Side)**: Network `172.16.10.0/24`
    
    - **Router A g0/1 (Public/Internet Interface)**: IP `75.1.1.1`
    - **Router A Tunnel0 Interface**: IP `172.16.20.1/24`
- **Router B (LAN Side)**: Network `172.16.30.0/24`
    
    - **Router B g0/1 (Public/Internet Interface)**: IP `80.1.1.1`
    - **Router B Tunnel0 Interface**: IP `172.16.20.2/24`
- **Tunnel Between A and B**:
    
    - **Tunnel0 IP on A**: `172.16.20.1/24`
    - **Tunnel0 IP on B**: `172.16.20.2/24`

### **Purpose**

You are configuring a **GRE tunnel** between Router A and Router B to enable communication between their respective **LAN networks**:

- Router A's LAN: `172.16.10.0/24`
- Router B's LAN: `172.16.30.0/24`

The GRE tunnel allows traffic between these private LANs to traverse the internet using encapsulation.

### **Configuration Breakdown**

#### **Router A Configuration**

`A(config)# ip route 172.16.30.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.20.2`
- **Static route**: Configures a route to reach Router B's LAN network (`172.16.30.0/24`) via the tunnel's destination IP (`172.16.20.2`), which is the Tunnel0 IP of Router B.

`A(config)# int tunnel0 `
`A(config-if)# no shut `
`A(config-if)# ip address 172.16.20.1 255.255.255.0 `
`A(config-if)# tunnel source 75.1.1.1 `
`A(config-if)# tunnel destination 80.1.1.1 `
`A(config-if)#ip mtu 1420 `
`A(config-if)# exit`

- **Tunnel Interface** (`tunnel0`):
    - **IP address**: Configured as `172.16.20.1/24` (the local end of the tunnel).
    - **Tunnel source**: The public IP of Router A's interface (`75.1.1.1`), facing the internet.
    - **Tunnel destination**: The public IP of Router B (`80.1.1.1`), which the tunnel will terminate at.
    - **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)**: Set to `1420`, which allows proper packet sizing and avoids fragmentation issues within the tunnel.

#### **Router B Configuration**:

`B(config)# ip route 172.16.10.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.20.1`
- **Static route**: Configures a route to reach Router A's LAN network (`172.16.10.0/24`) via the tunnel's destination IP (`172.16.20.1`), which is the Tunnel0 IP of Router A.

`B(config)# int tunnel0 `
`B(config-if)# no shut `
`B(config-if)# ip address 172.16.20.2 255.255.255.0` 
`B(config-if)# tunnel source 80.1.1.1 `
`B(config-if)# tunnel destination 75.1.1.1 `
`B(config-if)#ip mtu 1420 `
`B(config-if)# exit`

- **Tunnel Interface** (`tunnel0`):
    - **IP address**: Configured as `172.16.20.2/24` (the local end of the tunnel on Router B).
    - **Tunnel source**: The public IP of Router B's interface (`80.1.1.1`), facing the internet.
    - **Tunnel destination**: The public IP of Router A (`75.1.1.1`), where the tunnel will terminate.
    - **MTU**: Set to `1420`, ensuring compatibility with the tunnel MTU on Router A and avoiding fragmentation.

### **How the GRE Tunnel Works ?**

- The GRE tunnel connects Router A and Router B across the internet, allowing the private networks on either side (`172.16.10.0/24` and `172.16.30.0/24`) to communicate as if they were on the same local network.
- The **static routes** on both routers ensure that traffic intended for the other LAN (e.g., traffic from `172.16.10.0/24` destined for `172.16.30.0/24`) is forwarded through the tunnel.

---

### **Key Points**

- The tunnel encapsulates private traffic from the LANs, allowing it to travel across the public internet without being exposed.
- **MTU** of `1420` is specified to ensure that packets fit within the maximum transmission size across the tunnel without causing fragmentation.
- The **static routes** on both routers direct LAN traffic into the tunnel for cross-network communication.

This configuration effectively creates a secure, private link between the two routers and their LANs over the public internet using GRE encapsulation.
