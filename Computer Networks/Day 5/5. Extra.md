### **Ethernet and Network Expansion**

- Ethernet operates using **collision detection** and **prevention mechanisms** (CSMA/CD).
- As the number of devices on the network grows, **switches** are used to learn MAC addresses and forward frames efficiently.
- **Routers** introduced hierarchical addressing (IP addresses) to handle larger networks, splitting the address into a network and host part.
- **OSI Model**: The OSI reference model includes both the network layer (responsible for routing) and the transport layer (responsible for reliable communication).
