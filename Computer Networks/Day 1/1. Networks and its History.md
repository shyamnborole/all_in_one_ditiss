#### **PC-XT (1983)**

- IBM introduced the **PC-XT**, an enhanced version of the PC with added features like a **hard drive**.
- This further popularized personal computing by improving storage and performance capabilities.

---

#### **Impact of IBM’s Open Architecture**

- IBM adopted an **open architecture** strategy, allowing other companies to create compatible parts for their systems.
- Key contributors:
    - **Intel**: Supplied microprocessors.
    - **Seagate**: Manufactured hard drives.
- This led to the rise of **assembled PCs**, which were:
    - **Affordable**: Lower cost compared to IBM’s original products.
    - **Accessible**: Increased adoption worldwide due to reduced prices.
