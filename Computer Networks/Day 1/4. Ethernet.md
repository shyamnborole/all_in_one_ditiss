### **Ethernet Overview**

Ethernet is a widely-used networking technology for connecting devices in a Local Area Network (LAN). Governed by **IEEE standards**, it supports speeds ranging from **10 Mbps to 100 Gbps**.

#### **Variants**:

1. **Metro Ethernet**: Used for connecting businesses or regions, often spanning cities.
2. **Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet (PPPoE)**: Commonly used for internet access in home broadband networks.

### **Token Ring**

- An older networking technology that operated at speeds of **4 Mbps and 16 Mbps**.
- It became obsolete due to its **slower speeds** and limited efficiency compared to Ethernet.

### **How Ethernet Works?**

#### **CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access / Collision Detection)**

- **Older Ethernet** used CSMA/CD to handle communication between devices.
- **Process**:
    - **Carrier Sense**: Each device checks if the network is free (no one else is sending data).
	- **Multiple Access**: If the network is free, the device sends its data.
	- **Collision Detection**: If two devices send data at the same time, a **collision** occurs.
	- **Back off**: Both devices stop, wait for a random time, and then try again.
- **Modern Ethernet**: Uses switches, which create separate collision domains, eliminating collisions entirely.

#### **MAC Address**

- A **Media Access Control (MAC) Address** is a unique hardware identifier for devices in a network.
- **Structure**:
    - **48 bits**, divided into two parts:
        - **First 24 bits**: **Organizational Unique Identifier (OUI)**, assigned by IEEE to manufacturers.
        - **Last 24 bits**: Device-specific **serial number**.
- Example MAC Address: `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`.

#### **Communication Methods**

1. **Unicast**: One-to-one communication between devices.
2. **Broadcast**: One-to-all communication. A broadcast is sent to all devices using the special MAC address **FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF**.

### **Drawbacks of Older Ethernet**

1. **Increased Collisions**: Devices shared the same medium, leading to frequent collisions.
2. **Limited Media Availability**: Shared media like hubs were inefficient.

### **How Modern Ethernet Works**

- **Switches**: Modern Ethernet uses **network switches** instead of hubs.
- **Dedicated Communication**: Each device connected to a switch gets its **own path** to communicate, eliminating collisions.
- **Full-Duplex Mode**: Data can be sent and received simultaneously between devices.
- **MAC Address Table**: The switch learns the **MAC addresses** of connected devices and sends data directly to the correct destination.

This makes modern Ethernet faster, more reliable, and efficient compared to older methods!

>**NOTE:** A hub simply broadcasts data to all connected devices, while a switch intelligently directs data packets to their intended recipient based on MAC addresses, and a router routes data packets between different networks by examining their IP addresses, essentially acting as a gateway between networks; in essence, hubs operate at the physical layer, switches at the data link layer, and routers at the network layer of the OSI model.
