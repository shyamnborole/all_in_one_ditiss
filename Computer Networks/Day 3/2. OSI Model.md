**OSI Model Overview**:
- The **Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model** was developed by the **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)** in the late 1970s.
- It is a **standard for network communication**, providing a framework to understand and implement different communication protocols.

**Role of ISO in Standardization**:
- The **ISO** is responsible for defining various global standards, including those for **weights, volume (e.g., liter), distance (e.g., kilometer), length (e.g., meter), time (e.g., seconds)**, and more.
- **ISO certification** is given to companies that meet certain quality standards, ensuring they follow **standardized processes**.

**Why Standardization is Important**?
- **Standardization** is crucial for ensuring **flawless communication** between different networks and devices.
- Without these standards, communication across diverse systems and networks could become **inconsistent** or **error-prone**, making global connectivity difficult.
## **7 Layers**

| **Layers Of OSI Model** |
| :---------------------: |
|    Application Layer    |
|   Presentation Layer    |
|      Session Layer      |
|     Transport Layer     |
|      Network Layer      |
|     Datalink Layer      |
|     Physical Layer      |

### **1. Physical Layer**

- **Function**: Transmits raw bitstreams over a physical medium.
- **Protocols**: RS-232, ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network), 100BaseTX, Ethernet standards.
- **Devices**: Hubs, repeaters, network cables (Ethernet cables, fiber optics), and modems.

### **2. Data Link Layer**

- **Function**: Provides node-to-node data transfer and handles error correction from the physical layer.
- **Protocols**:
    
    - Ethernet (IEEE 802.3)
    - Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP)
    - Frame Relay
    - ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)
    
- **Devices**: Switches, bridges, and network interface cards (NICs).

### **3. Network Layer**

- **Function**: Manages packet forwarding, routing, and addressing across multiple networks.
- **Protocols**:
    
    - Internet Protocol (IPv4 and IPv6)
    - Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)
    - Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
    - Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS)
    
- **Devices**: Routers and layer 3 switches.

### **4. Transport Layer**

- **Function**: Ensures reliable or unreliable delivery of messages between hosts.
- **Protocols**:
    
    - Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
    - User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
    
- **Devices**: Firewalls (which can operate at this layer for traffic filtering).

### **5. Session Layer**

- **Function**: Manages sessions between applications, establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections.
- **Protocols**:
    
    - NetBIOS
    - Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
    - Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP)
    
- **Devices**: Gateways that manage sessions.

### **6. Presentation Layer**

- **Function**: Translates data formats for the application layer; handles encryption and compression.
- **Protocols**:
    
    - Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
    - Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    - JPEG, MPEG for media formats.
    
- **Devices**: None specifically; this layer is often implemented in software.

### **7. Application Layer**

- **Function**: Interfaces directly with end-user applications to provide network services.
- **Protocols**:
    
    - Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
    - Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)
    - File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
    - Domain Name System (DNS)
    
- **Devices**: Web servers, email servers, and application servers.

## **What exactly happens?**

- **Sender’s Process**: As data moves down through the layers, it is encapsulated into different forms:
    
    - **Data** at the Application Layer is encapsulated into a **Segment** at the Transport Layer.
    - The **Segment** is then encapsulated into a **Packet** at the Network Layer.
    - The **Packet** becomes a **Frame** at the Data Link Layer.
    - Finally, it is transmitted as **Bits** at the Physical Layer.
    
- **Receiver’s Process**: As data moves up through the layers, it is decapsulated:
    
    - **Bits** are received at the Physical Layer and converted back into a **Frame** at the Data Link Layer.
    - The **Frame** is then de-encapsulated into a **Packet** at the Network Layer.
    - The **Packet** is further de-encapsulated into a **Segment** at the Transport Layer.
    - Finally, the original **Data** is extracted at the Application Layer.
    

This **encapsulation** and **decapsulation** process ensures that data can be properly packaged for transmission and then accurately reconstructed upon receipt. Each layer adds or removes specific headers and trailers to facilitate this communication effectively.
