### **Audits by Purpose**
1. **Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT)**:  
   - Checks for vulnerabilities in systems or software.  
   - Determines whether vulnerabilities can be exploited.  
   - Typically performed annually.

2. **Procedural Audits**:  
   - Evaluates the effectiveness of processes and procedures.
