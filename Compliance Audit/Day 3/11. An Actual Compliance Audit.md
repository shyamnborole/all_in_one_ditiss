### **What is a Compliance Audit?**

A compliance audit is a structured evaluation of an organisation's policies, processes, and practices to ensure they meet specific legal, regulatory, or internal standards.

In the case of **GDPR compliance**, the audit focuses on:

- Verifying that personal data is handled lawfully, transparently, and securely.
- Ensuring user rights, data protection practices, and organisational security policies align with GDPR requirements.

### **Practical Activities During the Audit**

1. **Scan Systems and Devices:**
    
    - Audit PCs in **public regions** for outdated OS or anti-virus software.
    - Prioritise checking **unused or rarely used devices**, as they may pose vulnerabilities.
    - Begin with **critical systems** containing sensitive user data to ensure they are appropriately secured.
2. **Conduct Interviews:**
    
    - Speak with employees to confirm their understanding of GDPR practices.
    - Ensure employees handling sensitive data have signed **Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs)**.
3. **Physical Security Audit:**
    
    - Check that server rooms, storage areas, and other secure locations are accessible only to authorised personnel.
    - Confirm there is no unauthorised access or copying of sensitive data.

- Are periodic **security tests (e.g., penetration testing)** conducted?
- How is data permanently deleted when no longer needed?
- Are there policies for vendor and third-party compliance with GDPR?
