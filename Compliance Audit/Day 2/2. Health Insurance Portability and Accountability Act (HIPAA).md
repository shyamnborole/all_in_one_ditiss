### **Overview:**
- **Enacted**: In 1996 by the U.S. Congress.
- **Purpose**: To protect individuals' health information and ensure the privacy and security of health data. HIPAA provides patients with rights regarding their health data and mandates organisations to establish policies for data protection.
- **Applicability**: HIPAA applies only within the United States and governs entities such as health care providers, health plans, and health care clearinghouses (collectively called **covered entities**) and their business associates.

### **Covered Entities and Business Associates**
1. **Covered Entities**:
   - **Health Care Providers**: Hospitals, doctors, nurses, clinics, pharmacies, and other healthcare professionals who transmit health information electronically.
   - **Health Plans**: Insurance companies, HMOs, and government programs like Medicare and Medicaid that provide or pay for health care.
   - **Health Care Clearinghouses**: Entities that process health care transactions and data (e.g., billing companies).
   
2. **Business Associates**:
   - Entities or individuals who perform services on behalf of covered entities and have access to protected health information (PHI). Examples include IT service providers, legal services, and accounting firms.

### **Protected Health Information (PHI)**
- PHI includes any health information (written, electronic, or oral) that can identify an individual and relates to:
   - The individual’s past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition.
   - The provision of health care to the individual.
   - The past, present, or future payment for the provision of health care.
- Examples include medical records, test results, prescriptions, and billing information.

### **Main HIPAA Rules**
1. **Privacy Rule**:
   - **Purpose**: Protects the privacy of PHI.
   - **Key Provisions**:
     - Individuals have the right to access, inspect, and obtain copies of their health records.
     - Requires that health care providers and plans establish safeguards to ensure PHI is not used or disclosed improperly.
     - Limits how PHI can be shared, including restrictions on disclosing information without patient consent (except for certain public health or legal purposes).
     - Grants individuals the right to request corrections to their health records and request restrictions on how their information is shared.
     - **Minimum Necessary Standard**: Only the minimum necessary amount of PHI should be accessed, used, or disclosed to accomplish a task.
     - Requires **Notice of Privacy Practices** (NPP) that must be provided to patients explaining their rights under HIPAA.

2. **Security Rule**:
   - **Purpose**: Establishes requirements for the security of electronic PHI (ePHI).
   - **Key Provisions**:
     - **Administrative Safeguards**: Policies and procedures to manage the selection, development, and use of security measures to protect ePHI. This includes the appointment of a **Security Officer**.
     - **Physical Safeguards**: Measures to protect the physical environment in which ePHI is stored, such as locking file cabinets and secure computer servers.
     - **Technical Safeguards**: Protects ePHI during transmission and storage through encryption, access control, audit trails, and secure communication methods (e.g., VPNs, SSL/TLS).
     - Regular **Risk Analysis**: Covered entities must conduct regular assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities in their security systems.
     - **Access Control**: Only authorized individuals should have access to ePHI, based on job roles.

3. **Breach Notification Rule**:
   - **Purpose**: Mandates that covered entities notify affected individuals, HHS, and in some cases, the media when there is a breach of unsecured PHI.
   - **Key Provisions**:
     - **Breach Notification**: If a data breach occurs (where PHI is accessed or disclosed without authorisation), the covered entity must notify the individual within 60 days.
     - If the breach affects 500 or more individuals, notification to the media and HHS is required.
     - For smaller breaches, covered entities may notify HHS annually.
     - The breach notification must include the nature of the breach, the types of PHI involved, and steps individuals can take to protect themselves.

### **Role of a Privacy Officer**
- HIPAA requires organisations to appoint a **Privacy Officer**, responsible for overseeing the organisation’s adherence to the Privacy Rule and ensuring that policies regarding PHI are followed.
- Responsibilities include:
   - Developing and enforcing privacy policies.
   - Training staff on privacy procedures.
   - Responding to patient complaints or inquiries regarding their health information.
   - Investigating potential violations or breaches of PHI.
   - Ensuring patient consent and authorisation forms are used appropriately.

### **Enforcement and Penalties**
- **Enforcement**: The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office for Civil Rights (OCR), is responsible for enforcing HIPAA compliance. State Attorneys General can also bring lawsuits for HIPAA violations.
- **Penalties**:
   - Violations can result in civil and criminal penalties, depending on the severity and nature of the violation.
   - **Civil Penalties**: Range from $100 to $50,000 per violation, with a maximum annual penalty of $1.5 million.
   - **Criminal Penalties**: Can result in fines up to $250,000 and imprisonment for up to 10 years for the most serious offenses (e.g., intentional misuse of PHI for personal gain).

---

### **Other HIPAA Provisions**
- **Transaction and Code Sets Rule**: Standardises electronic health care transactions and code sets used for billing and reporting.
- **Unique Identifiers Rule**: Requires the use of unique identifiers for health care providers, employers, health plans, and individuals.
- **Portability Provisions**: Allows individuals to transfer and continue health insurance coverage when changing jobs or moving between states.

### **Patient Rights Under HIPAA**
- **Access to Health Information**: Patients can request access to their health records and request copies of their medical information.
- **Amendment of Records**: Patients can request corrections to their health records if they believe there is an error.
- **Request for Restrictions**: Patients can request that their health information not be disclosed to certain individuals or entities.
- **Right to an Accounting of Disclosures**: Patients can request a list of instances where their health information has been shared without their consent.
- **Confidential Communication**: Patients can request that communications about their health care (e.g., test results) be sent to alternate addresses or through other means to ensure privacy.

### **HIPAA and Technology**
- As healthcare becomes increasingly digital, HIPAA's rules ensure that emerging technologies—such as electronic health records (EHR), telemedicine, and cloud computing—adhere to strict data protection measures.
   - Entities using cloud services or third-party IT vendors must ensure these vendors comply with HIPAA and sign a **Business Associate Agreement (BAA)** outlining the vendor’s responsibilities regarding PHI protection.
