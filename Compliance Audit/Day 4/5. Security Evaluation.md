#### **What is Security Evaluation?**

- The process of assessing and verifying the **effectiveness of security measures** within an organisation or system.
- Ensures compliance with standards, identifies vulnerabilities, and determines the resilience of systems against potential threats.

### **Key Requirements for Security Evaluation**

1. **Security Policies and Procedures**
    
    - Ensure documented policies align with industry standards (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR).
    - Include acceptable use, access control, and incident management policies.
2. **Risk Assessment**
    
    - Identify, analyze, and evaluate security risks.
    - Use qualitative or quantitative methods to prioritize risks based on impact and likelihood.
3. **Access Control Mechanisms**
    
    - Verify role-based or privilege-based access controls are in place.
    - Ensure proper authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., MFA).
4. **Incident Response and Management**
    
    - Evaluate the effectiveness of incident detection, reporting, and response processes.
    - Ensure the organization has an **Incident Response Plan (IRP).**
5. **Data Protection and Encryption**
    
    - Verify that sensitive data is encrypted during transmission and at rest.
    - Assess compliance with data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
6. **Physical Security Controls**
    
    - Check for secure facility access, surveillance systems, and environmental controls.
7. **Compliance Checks**
    
    - Ensure adherence to relevant standards, regulations, and frameworks (e.g., SOC, PCI DSS, NIST).
8. **System and Application Security**
    
    - Test for vulnerabilities in applications, servers, and networks (e.g., via penetration testing).
    - Evaluate patch management and system update policies.
9. **Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery**
    
    - Verify backup and recovery procedures.
    - Assess plans for maintaining operations during and after a disruption.
10. **Training and Awareness**
    
    - Evaluate employee understanding of security policies and potential threats.
    - Ensure regular training programs are conducted.
