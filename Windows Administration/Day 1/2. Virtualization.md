### **Virtualization: Simulation vs. Emulation**

- **Simulation**: Models a system’s behavior under different conditions (e.g., flight simulators).
- **Emulation**: Replicates another system’s functionality on different hardware (e.g., game console emulators).

### **Hypervisors: Types of Virtualization Software**

- **Type 1 (Bare Metal)**: Installed directly on hardware (e.g., Hyper-V, VMWare ESXi).
- **Type 2 (Hosted)**: Runs as an application on an existing OS (e.g., VirtualBox, VMWare Player).

### **Storage Management & RAID**

- **Disk Management Tools**: Use tools like `diskmgmt.msc` to manage storage.
- **RAID** (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) Types:
    - **RAID 1 (Mirroring)**: Data is duplicated on two hard disks, providing redundancy.
    - **RAID 5 (Striping with Parity)**: Data is divided across multiple disks, with parity information for recovery in case of failure.
