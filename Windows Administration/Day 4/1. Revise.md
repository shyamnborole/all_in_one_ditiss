If you want two domains to trust each other then create both domains in the same forest.
Every domain has a DC and an ADC.
We can have multiple ADCs.

Why DNS is required?
to make your work easy. 

You have to give primary and secondary DNS to the machine. DNS is like an enquiry office.
Secondary DNS is the IP of ADC (maybe, check it)
