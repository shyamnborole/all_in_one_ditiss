DNS is used to map domain names to IP addresses. It operates on **Port 53 (UDP/TCP)**.

1. **Root Servers**:
    
    - Top-level DNS servers, with fixed IPs, responsible for directing queries to the correct Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers.
    - There are 13 root server clusters globally (labeled A to M).
2. **TLD Servers**:
    
    - Handle domains like `.com`, `.org`, `.edu`, and country-specific TLDs like `.in` (India) or `.uk` (UK).
    - These servers store information for second-level domains.

Three types of zones in **DNS**:
1. **Primary**: First time the domain is created by creating a primary zone.
2. **Secondary**: Works as a backup for primary zone hosted on a separate server. It updates as soon as the changes are made in the primary zone. Use when you need IP immediately. While copying the data TCP 53 is used for reliability.
3. **Stub**: This zone doesn't update itself when changes are made in the primary zone. This is used when we are not accessing the IPs frequently.

Data replication?
Two types: push and pull style.

### **Key DNS Organizations**

- **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)**:
    
    - Develops internet standards (like TCP/IP protocols).
- **IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority)**:
    
    - Oversees global IP address allocation and manages the DNS root zone.
- **ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers)**:
    
    - Responsible for domain name registration and DNS root management.

### **DNS Lookup Types**

- **Forward Lookup**:
    - Name → IP Address: Client provides a domain name, DNS returns the corresponding IP.
- **Reverse Lookup**:
    - IP Address → Name: Client provides an IP address, DNS returns the corresponding domain name.
    - Example: An IP like `192.168.10.0` will be represented as `0.10.168.192.in-addr.arpa` in reverse.

### **DNS Record Types**

1. **A Record** (IPv4): Maps domain name to an IPv4 address.
2. **AAAA Record** (IPv6): Maps domain name to an IPv6 address.
3. **PTR Record**: Pointer record, used for reverse lookups (IP to name mapping).
4. **CNAME Record**: Alias record, allows multiple names for the same IP.
5. **MX Record** (Mail Exchange): Identifies the mail server for a domain.
    - This is a frequently asked interview question.
6. **SRV Record** (Service Locator): Provides the IP and port for specific services.

### **Active Directory Protocols**

- **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)**: Used to access and maintain distributed directory information services over an IP network. Operates on **Port 389 (TCP)**.
- **Kerberos**: A network authentication protocol that provides secure authentication for users and services in a network using secret-key cryptography. Operates on **Port 88 (TCP/UDP)**.
- **Kpasswd**: A utility for changing user passwords in Kerberos.

### **Miscellaneous Concepts**

- **Link-Local IP**: In IPv6, link-local addresses (starting with `fe80:`) are used for communication within the same network segment and are not routable on the internet.
    
- **Domains = Zones**: In DNS, domains can be broken down into zones, each containing information about a part of the domain's namespace.

### **Useful Commands**

- **ping**: Use to check domain connectivity and trust within a forest.
    
- **nslookup/dig**: Tools to query DNS records. (`nslookup` is used in Windows, and `dig` is used in Linux). Here UDP 53 is used.
    
- **ipconfig/displaydns**: Displays the DNS cache on a system.

- **ipconfig /all**: Displays detailed network information, including DNS settings.
    
- **ARPA**: (Advanced Research Projects Agency) – responsible for early internet development.
