**Trust Relationships in Domains**

- **Trust** is a relationship between domains that allows one domain to access resources in another domain.

### **Types of Trusts**

1. **One-way Trust**:
    
    - Domain A → Domain B: Domain B can access resources in Domain A.
    - Domain A cannot access resources in Domain B.
    - **Note**: Access is always opposite to trust directions.
2. **Two-way Trust**:
    
    - Domain A ↔ Domain B: Both domains can access each other's resources.
3. **Transitive Trust**:
    
    - Domain A ↔ Domain B ↔ Domain C: Trust is extended to all domains, forming a trust chain.
    - All domains share two-way trust due to their relationship, and this trust extends across multiple domains.

### **Trust in Active Directory (AD) Forest**

- **Forest**: A collection of domains in Active Directory.
    - **Forest Root Domain**: The primary domain in a forest (e.g., `cdac.lab`).
        
    - **Child Domain**: A domain under the forest root (e.g., `acts.cdac.lab`).
        
    - **Tree Domain**: A separate domain in the same forest (e.g., `sunbeam.lab`).
        
    - Every domain tree and child domain in a forest has two-way direct trust with the forest root domain.
        
    - Tree domains and child domains also have a two-way transitive trust.
        
**Example**:

- `cdac.lab` (Forest Root) ↔ `acts.cdac.lab` (Child Domain)
- `cdac.lab` ↔ `sunbeam.lab` (Tree Domain)
- This forms a two-way transitive trust between the child domain and the tree domain.

### **Key Concepts**

- **Command to access AD**: `dsa.msc` starts the "Active Directory Users and Computers" tool.
- **Managing User Accounts**:
    - You can select users in AD, assign login permissions, set time restrictions, and choose an account expiration date.
- **Creating an Active Directory Domain Service (ADS)**:
    
    - Go to Add Roles & Features → Active Directory and Domain Services → Add domain to an existing domain.
    
    **Note**: Only administrators can log into Domain Controllers (DC) and Additional Domain Controllers (ADC).
