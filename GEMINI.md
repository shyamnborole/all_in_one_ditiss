## Usage

The notes in this directory are intended for study and revision for the PG-DITISS course. The content is organized by subject and then by day, which likely corresponds to the lectures. The `.drawio` files alongside some of the Computer Networks notes suggest that these are diagrams that can be viewed with a tool that supports this format.

The notes are written in Markdown and can be viewed with any Markdown viewer or editor. The repository is designed for personal study and for sharing with classmates.
