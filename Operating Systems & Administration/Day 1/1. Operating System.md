### **Operating System (OS)**

An Operating System is a crucial software that enables hardware to function by acting as an interface between the hardware and the end user, as well as between the hardware and application software.

#### **Key Points**

1. **Components of a Computer System**:
    
    - CPU (Central Processing Unit)
    - RAM (Random Access Memory)
    - Monitor
    - Keyboard
    - Hard Disk
    
    _Note_: A computer system requires both hardware and software (including the OS) to function correctly.
    
2. **Buses in a Computer System**: Buses are used to transmit data and signals within the computer system. The three main types of buses are:
    
    - **Data Bus**: Bi-directional, carries data between the processor, memory, and peripherals.
    - **Address Bus**: Uni-directional, carries memory addresses from the processor to other components.
    - **Control Bus**: Carries control signals, such as read/write commands, to ensure proper data flow and synchronisation.
3. **Definitions of an Operating System**:
    
    - **Interface**:
        - The OS acts as an interface between the **end-user** and **hardware**, allowing users to interact with the computer.
        - It also serves as an interface between **application software** and **hardware**, managing the execution of software.
    - **Control Program**:
        - The OS controls the execution of all application software that runs on the computer.
    - **Resource Manager**:
        - The OS allocates hardware resources such as CPU time, memory, and storage to programs, ensuring they operate efficiently.
4. **OS Components (when purchasing an OS)**:
    
    - **Kernel**: The core part of the operating system that directly manages hardware resources.
    - **Application Software**: Programs that allow users to perform tasks, like a web browser or word processor.
    - **System Utilities**: Tools that display system information, status, or help manage the OS (e.g., task manager, file manager).

#### **Note**

The more you explore operating systems, the more perspectives you'll encounter. Different roles, such as a developer or system administrator, may emphasise different aspects of the OS.
