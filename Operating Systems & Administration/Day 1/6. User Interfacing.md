### **User Interfacing**

In an operating system, there are two main types of interfaces through which users can interact with the system:

1. **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**:
    
    - Interaction through graphical elements like windows, icons, and buttons.
    - More user-friendly, typically used by casual users.
2. **CLI (Command-Line Interface)**:
    
    - Interaction through text-based commands.
    - Used by advanced users and administrators for greater control and flexibility.

### **Shell**

The **shell** serves as an **intermediary between the user and the operating system**. It is also referred to as a **command interpreter** because it interprets the commands entered by the user and then passes them to the OS for execution.

- After the OS executes the command, the **shell** displays the output to the user.

#### **Common Shells in Linux**

- **bash (Bourne Again Shell)**:
    - The default shell in most Linux distributions.
    - It's an advanced version of the original **sh** (the Unix shell).
- **Terminal**:
    - A GUI application that gives access to the CLI.
    - When using the terminal, you are essentially interacting with the **bash shell** by default in most Linux systems.

### **Extra: GNU Project and Free Software**

- **GNU** stands for **GNU’s Not Unix**. It was a project aimed at creating a Unix-like operating system that was **free** and **open source**.
    - The **GNU project** promoted the development of free software that anyone could use, modify, and share.
    - **GPL (General Public License)**: A key aspect of GNU's philosophy, under which software is made available to the public **free of cost**. Any software licensed under GPL must remain free and open.

#### **Linux Distributions**

- All Linux distributions (distros) are **community-driven** projects. This means that developers from around the world contribute to their development.
- GNU/Linux is often used to refer to Linux systems because many parts of the operating system are built using GNU tools and software.
