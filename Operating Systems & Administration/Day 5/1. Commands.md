#### 2. `rename` Command

- **Purpose**: Allows renaming of multiple files at once. This is useful when the files share something in common (e.g., their extension).
    
- **Examples**:
    
    - `rename "s/file/test/" *.txt`
        - **Meaning**: Replaces the word "file" with "test" in all `.txt` files.
    - `rename "s/txt/doc/" *.txt`
        - **Meaning**: Changes the extension of all `.txt` files to `.doc`.
