### Shell Scripting Overview

**Shell scripting** is interpreted by the shell itself and is mainly used for:

- Automation
- Configuration
- Writing security patches
- Building larger software
- Providing development support

A **Shell Script** is essentially a set of commands combined with programming constructs like variables, functions, conditionals, and loops. The file extension for shell scripts is `.sh`.

### 1. How Shell Scripts Work

- Like Python, shell scripts are read **line by line** (from top to bottom).
- To run the script, we use `bash`.
- However, the script isn’t executable by default; we need to give it execution permissions using the `chmod` command.
- After adding execution permissions, we can run the script with `./scriptname.sh`.

Internally, a **bash** program runs the script.

**Note**: Features may vary from shell to shell, so scripts written for one shell might not run correctly on another.

---

### 2. Shebang Line (`#!`)

- If you are using only one shell, the **Shebang Line** is optional.
- However, it’s considered good practice to include it, especially if using multiple shells.
- The **Shebang Line** indicates the interpreter to be used for running the script (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`).

### 3. Basic Commands

#### `echo` Command

- **By default**: `echo` outputs a newline character at the end.
- **To avoid newlines**: Use the `-n` option (e.g., `echo -n`).
- **Escape sequences**: Don’t work by default in `echo`. Use the `-e` option to enable them.

#### Comments

- In shell scripts, comments are written with `#`.
- In the **Shebang Line**, use `#!`.

---

### 4. Variables in Shell Scripting

- Shell script variables **don’t have data types**.
    
- **Declaring a variable**:  
    `<variable_name>=<value>`  
    _(No spaces around the equals sign)_
    
- **Using a variable**:  
    `$<variable_name>`
    
- **String values**: Can be written with or without single or double quotes.
    

In shell scripting, variables are often referred to as **parameters**, and **parameter substitution** is when the variable name is replaced with its value.

---

### 5. Environment Variables

- Environment variables can be accessed globally, from any shell.
- They store environment information and are written in uppercase (e.g., `PATH`).
- **To view environment variables**: Use the `env` command.

**Example**:

- `PATH`: Specifies directories where executable programs are located.

### 6. `man` Command

The `man` command shows the manual for Linux commands. Different sections include:

- **1**: Executable programs or shell commands
- **2**: System calls
- **3**: Library calls
- **4**: Special files
- **5**: File formats and conventions
- **6**: Games
- **7**: Miscellaneous
- **8**: System administration commands
- **9**: Kernel routines

To view the library call for the `printf` function:  
`man 3 printf`

---

### 7. User Input in Shell Scripts

- **Using `read`**:  
    `read <variable>`
    - Allows you to take input from the user.
    - You can read multiple variables in one line.

---

### 8. Arithmetic Operations

#### `expr` Command

- Used for **basic arithmetic** (integers only, not floats).
- **Multiplication**: Requires the `*` to be escaped (`\*`), as it’s a meta-character in shell scripts.

#### `bc` Command

- The **`bc` command** (basic calculator) is used for more advanced arithmetic, including floats.
- Redirection can be used with `bc` to output calculations to a file or standard output.

**Example**:
`echo 1.5 + 1.5 | bc`
Output:  
`3.0`

---

### 9. Command Substitution

- Command substitution replaces a command with its output.
    
    Two ways to use it:
    
    1. `$(command)`
    2. `` `command` ``

---

### 10. Conditional Statements in Shell Scripting

#### `if` Statements:
if [ condition ]
then    ... 
elif [ condition ]
then    ... 
else    ...
fi

- **Note**: Indentation is optional, but recommended for readability.

#### `case` Statements:

case $<variable> in
1|4)
   ...
   ;;
2)
   ...
   ;;
*)
   ...
   ;;
esac


- `*`: Acts as the default case.
- Cases can include integers, floats, or strings (e.g., "one", "two").
