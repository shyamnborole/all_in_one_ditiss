## **Types of Loops in Shell Scripting**

1. **For Loop**
2. **While Loop**
3. **Until Loop**
4. **Select Loop**

### **1. While Loop**

A `while` loop repeats as long as the condition remains true. The loop structure allows for initialisation, execution, and modification of variables.

#### **Syntax:**

`initialisation` 
`while [ condition ]`
`do` 
	`body`     
	`modification` 
`done`

- **Break** and **Continue** statements can be used to exit the loop or skip iterations, respectively.

### **2. Until Loop**

The `until` loop is similar to the `while` loop, but the body of the loop executes when the condition is **false**. Once the condition becomes true, the loop terminates. This is the reverse of how the `while` loop works.

#### **Syntax:**

`initialisation` 
`until [ condition ]`
`do` 
	`body`     
	`modification` 
`done`

- **Break** and **Continue** statements can also be used in `until` loops.
- This type of loop is often preferred for **menu-driven programs**.

### **3. For Loop**

The `for` loop allows iteration over a sequence or a range of values.

#### **C-Style For Loop Syntax:**

`for (( initialisation; condition; modification ))`
`do` 
	`body` 
`done`

- This syntax works similarly to `for` loops in languages like C.
- You can use operators like `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=` in the condition.

#### **Python-Style For Loop Syntax:**

In shell scripting, `for` loops can also iterate over a sequence of values:

`for var in sequence` 
`do`
	`body` 
`done`

- Example: `for i in {1..10}` will loop from 1 to 10.

### **4. Select Loop**

A `select` loop is used to create a simple menu-driven system in a shell script. It presents a numbered list of choices and prompts the user to select one.

#### **Syntax:**

`select var in option1 option2 option3` 
`do`     `
	`body` 
`done`

- Each option in the list is displayed as a menu.
- It works well for interactive scripts and uses simple/compound commands for execution based on user input.

## **seq Command**

The `seq` command is used to generate sequences of numbers.

#### **Examples:**

- `seq 10`: Prints numbers from 1 to 10.
- `seq 11 20`: Prints numbers from 11 to 20.
- `seq 11 2 20`: Prints numbers from 11 to 20 with a step of 2.
- `seq 11 -1 5`: Prints numbers from 11 down to 5 (decrementing by 1).

## **File Conditionals**

File conditionals are used to check properties of files, such as existence, type, and permissions.

#### **Common File Conditionals:**

- `-e $name_or_path`: True if the file or path exists.
- `-f $name`: True if the file is a regular file.
- `-d $name`: True if the file is a directory.
- `-p $name`: True if the file is a named pipe.
- `-s $name`: True if the file is not empty.
- `-l $name`: True if the file is a symbolic link.
- `-c $name`: True if the file is a character special file.
- `-b $name`: True if the file is a block special file.
- `-r $name`: True if the file has read permission.
- `-w $name`: True if the file has write permission.
- `-x $name`: True if the file has execute permission.
