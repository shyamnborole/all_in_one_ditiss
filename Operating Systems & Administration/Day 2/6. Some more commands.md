### File Manipulation Commands

#### Displaying File Content

1. **Number Lines**:
    `cat -n <filename>`
    - Displays the contents of the file with line numbers.
2. **View First Lines**:
    `head <filename>`
    - Displays the first 10 lines of the file by default.
3. **View Last Lines**:
    `tail <filename>`
    - Displays the last 10 lines of the file by default.
4. **View Specific Number of Lines from Start**:
    `head -6 <filename>`
    - Displays the first 6 lines of the file.
5. **View Specific Number of Lines from End**:
    `tail -5 <filename>`
    - Displays the last 5 lines of the file.

#### Extracting Middle Elements

- There is no direct option to print specific middle elements of a file. To achieve this, you need to combine commands, such as using `head` and `tail`.

#### Sorting and Reversing Content

1. **Sort File**:
    `sort <filename>`
    - Sorts the file contents in lexicographical order (alphabetically).
2. **Number-wise Sorting**:
    `sort -n <filename>`
    - Sorts the file contents numerically.
3. **Reverse File Horizontally**:
    `rev <filename>`
    - Reverses the contents of the file line by line (horizontally).
4. **Reverse File Vertically**:
    `tac <filename>`
    - Displays the file contents in reverse order (vertically).
5. **Display Unique Values**:
    `uniq <filename>`
    - Displays only unique values in the file.
    - Works only on sorted data and requires consecutive duplicates to be filtered.
