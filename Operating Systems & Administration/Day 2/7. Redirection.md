### Console Standard Files

The console operates with three internal standard files:

1. **Standard Input File**: Used to take input.
2. **Standard Output File**: Used to display output.
3. **Standard Error File**: Used to display error messages.

These files are collectively referred to as **standard files**.

There are two ways to give output of one command to another:
**Redirection and Pipes**

### Redirection

Redirection allows you to control the flow of input and output in the console. There are three main types of redirection:

1. **Input Redirection**:
    
    - Instead of taking input from the standard input file, you can take input from another file.
    - Operator: `<`
    - Example:
        `cat < test.txt`
        
2. **Output Redirection**:
    
    - Instead of writing output to the standard output file, you can write it to another file.
    - Operator: `>`
    - Example:
        `ls > lsout.txt`
        
3. **Error Redirection**:
    
    - Instead of writing errors to the standard error file, you can write errors to another file.
    - Operator: `2>`
    - Example:
        `command 2> error.txt`
    - You can redirect both standard output and standard error to the same file using:
        `command > output.txt 2>&1`

### Pipes

Pipes allow you to connect the output of one command to the input of another. There are two types of pipes:

1. **Named Pipe**:
    
    - Created using the `mkfifo()` function.
    - Can be used for two logically unrelated processes.
2. **Unnamed Pipe**:
    
    - Created using the `pipe()` function.
    - Can be used for two related processes.

**Note**: Both pipes function similarly, but they are used under different circumstances.

### Additional Notes

- The `bc` command can be used to perform mathematical operations, and input redirection can also be applied here.
- You can combine input and output redirection together, but not all commands support this.
