**Process**: Running an instance of a program.  
**Program**: A set of instructions for the machine (CPU).

### Compilation Process

The compilation process involves converting source code into machine code. This is achieved through a **compiler**, which is also known as a **toolchain**.

#### Toolchain Components

A typical toolchain consists of the following components:

1. **Pre-processor**: Processes preprocessor directives and removes comments from the source code.
2. **Compiler**:
    - Checks for syntax errors and informs the programmer if any errors are found.
    - Converts expanded source code to assembly code.
    - Assigns addresses to variables and functions.
    - Creates a **symbol table** that stores information about symbols, which include the program's functions and variables.
3. **Assembler**: Converts assembly code into machine code.
4. **Linker**:
    - Combines the generated machine code with library machine code to create an executable file.
    - Adds an executable header containing information about the program.
5. **Debugger**: Helps identify and fix bugs in the code.

#### Example: GCC Toolchain

The **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)** is a widely used toolchain for converting C code into machine code. Its components include:

1. **Pre-processor**: CPP
2. **Compiler**: CCI
3. **Assembler**: AS
4. **Linker**: LD
5. **Debugger**: GDB

### Machine Code Generation

- The final output of the tool-chain is machine code, which is in binary format.
- This machine code is organised into sections, hence referred to as **sectioned binary**.
- The sectioned binary is stored on the hard disk.
