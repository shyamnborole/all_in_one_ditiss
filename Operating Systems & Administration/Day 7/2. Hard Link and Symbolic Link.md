### **Hard Link**

A **hard link** is essentially another name for the same file. It doesn’t create a new file; instead, it creates an additional directory entry that points to the same **inode** (a structure that stores metadata about the file).

#### **Key Points**

- **Same inode number**: Both the original file and the hard link share the same inode and thus the same File Control Block (FCB) and data block.
- **Link count increases**: When a hard link is created, the **link count** of the inode increases, indicating how many directory entries point to the same file.
- **File is not deleted**: If the original file is deleted, the data remains available through the hard link because the inode and data block are still in use until the link count becomes zero.
- **No new data block**: Hard links do not consume additional disk space beyond the new directory entry.

#### **Example**
`ln f1.txt f2.txt`

- Both `f1.txt` and `f2.txt` will now point to the same data.

#### **When to use Hard Links?**

- When you need multiple names for the same file in the same file system and want changes to one file to reflect in the other.

### **Symbolic Link**

A **symbolic link** (or **symlink**) is a special type of file that points to another file or directory by its **path**. It is like a shortcut.

#### **Key Points**

- **Different inode numbers**: A symbolic link has its own inode and FCB, but it only stores the path to the target file.
- **No increase in link count**: The original file's link count doesn’t change when a symbolic link is created.
- **New data block**: A new data block and FCB are created for the symbolic link, which holds the path to the original file.
- **Broken link if the original file is deleted**: If the original file is deleted, the symbolic link points to nothing, and attempting to use it will result in an error unless a new file is created with the same name.

#### **Example**

`ln -s f1.txt f2.txt`

- `f2.txt` will act as a shortcut to `f1.txt`. If `f1.txt` is moved or deleted, `f2.txt` will be broken.

#### **When to use Symbolic Links**

- When you need to link to files across different file systems or partitions.
- To create shortcuts (like on the desktop).

### **Differences Between Hard Link and Symbolic Link**

| Feature             | Hard Link                                                                 | Symbolic Link                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inode**           | Shares the same inode as the original file                                | Has its own inode; contains the path to the file                        |
| **Link Count**      | Increases the link count of the original file                             | Does not affect the link count of the original file                     |
| **Storage**         | Points directly to the data block                                         | Stores the path of the target file                                      |
| **Deletion Impact** | File data remains accessible via the link even if the original is deleted | If the original file is deleted, the link becomes broken                |
| **Cross-Partition** | Cannot be used across different file systems or partitions                | Can link to files across different partitions or file systems           |
| **Use Case**        | To create multiple names for the same file                                | To create shortcuts or link to files across directories or file systems |
