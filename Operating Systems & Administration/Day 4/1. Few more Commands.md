## **Types of Commands in Linux**

#### **1. Internal Commands**

- **Definition**: Commands implemented within the shell program itself.
- **Executable File**: Not available on the disk.

#### **2. External Commands**

- **Definition**: Commands implemented separately from the shell.
- **Executable Locations**: Found on the hard disk in directories such as `/bin`, `/sbin`, `/usr/bin`, and `/usr/sbin`.

### **Command Types and Tools**

- **`type` Command**: Checks if a command is internal or external.
    
    - Examples:
        - `type echo` → `echo is a shell builtin`
        - `type mkdir` → `mkdir is /usr/bin/mkdir`
        - `type cd` → `cd is a shell builtin`
- **`which` Command**: Provides the path of a given command (location on the hard disk).
    
    - Examples:
        - `which ls` → `/usr/bin/ls`
        - `which cd` → `/usr/bin/cd`
        - `which echo` → `/usr/bin/echo`
        - `which pwd` → `/usr/bin/pwd`
        - `which mkdir` → `/usr/bin/mkdir`
- **`whereis` Command**: Gives the path of the command and its manual page.
    
    - Examples:
        - `whereis ls` → `ls: /usr/bin/ls /usr/share/man/man1/ls.1.gz`
        - `whereis cd` → `cd:`
        - `whereis alias` → `alias:`

### **File Handling in Shell**

- Internal commands are executed inside the shell only.
    
- The shell deals with text files and not special files like PDFs.
    
- **`open` Command**:
    
    - Use to open files based on their paths. It checks the file's magic number and opens the appropriate application.
    - Example: Opening a PDF file will launch a PDF viewer.

### **Tools for Executable Files**

- **`readelf`**: Displays detailed information from ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files, such as headers, sections, and symbols.
- **`objdump`**: Offers broader functionality, including disassembling code and showing headers, sections, and symbol tables for various binary formats.
---
### **Manual Pages**

- Use `man` to access manual entries for commands.
    - Example: `man alias` returns "No manual entry for alias" because it's built-in.
    - Instead, use `man bash` for bash-related commands.
---
### **Command Execution**

- **Synchronous Execution**: Commands execute one after the other, with the shell waiting for the current command to finish before proceeding.
    
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Commands execute in the background, allowing immediate execution of other commands. This is done using `&` at the end of the command.
    
    - Example: `cat &`
    - Check status with `ps` command.
    - Use `kill` command to stop background processes.
        - `kill -l`: Lists signals (64 in total, each with a predefined meaning).
        - Examples of killing a process:
            - `kill -9 5480` (using PID)
            - `kill -SIGKILL 5480`
            - `pkill -9 cat` (can kill multiple processes)
---
### **Logical Operators**

- **`&&` (AND Operator)**:
    
    - Nest commands; the second command executes only if the first is successful.
    - Example: `ls && pwd`
    - If the first command fails (e.g., `ls -W`), the second won't execute.
- **`;` (Separator)**:
    
    - Executes the second command regardless of the first command's success or failure.
- **`||` (OR Operator)**:
    
    - The second command executes only if the first fails.
    - Example: `ls || pwd`
    - If `ls -W` generates an error, the error is displayed, and the second command executes.
