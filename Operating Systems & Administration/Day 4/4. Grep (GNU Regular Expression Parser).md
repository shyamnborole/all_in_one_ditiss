#### **Regular Expression / Pattern**

- **Definition:** A collection/set/combination of characters used for searching or matching purposes.
    
- **Types of Characters:**
    
    1. **Simple Characters:** A-Z, a-z, 0-9
    2. **Special/Wildcard/Meta Characters:** `.`, `*`, `+`, `?`, `()`, `[]`, `{}`, `\`, `|`, etc.
        - **Basic Wildcard:** Matches a single character.
        - **Extended Wildcard:** Offers additional matching capabilities.
- **Examples of Regular Expressions:**
    - `a`
    - `a+b`
    - `a(123)c`
    - `ai{2}c`

#### **Syntax for Using `grep`:**

- Basic syntax:
    `grep "pattern" <filename>`
    or
    `grep [options] "pattern" <filename>`

#### **Common `grep` Options:**

- `-w`: Matches the exact pattern only.
- `-n`: Prints matching lines with line numbers.
- `-v`: Prints lines that do not contain the specified pattern.
- `-i`: Ignores case sensitivity.
- `^`: Matches lines starting with the specified pattern. (e.g., `^is`)
- `$`: Matches lines ending with the specified pattern. (e.g., `is$`)
- `^is$`: Matches lines containing only this pattern.

#### **Examples of Using `grep`:**

- `grep b[aou]g select.txt`: Matches single occurrences of `b` followed by any one character (a, o, or u) and then `g`.
- `grep b[^aou]g select.txt`: Prints lines that do not have the specified pattern after the `^`.
- `grep b.g select.txt`: Prints lines with a single character between `b` and `g`.

- **Escape Sequences:**
    - `grep "b*g" select.txt`: Asterisk `*` stands for 0 or more occurrences.
    - `grep "b\*g" select.txt`: Uses escape sequence to treat `*` as a regular character.
    - `grep "b[*]g" select.txt`: Treats `*` as a regular character.
    - `grep -F "b*g" select.txt`: Treats `*` as a literal character due to `-F`.
    - `fgrep "b*g" select.txt`: Similar function as above.

- `grep "ba?g" repeat.txt`: The `?` wildcard matches 0 or 1 occurrence of the preceding character.
- `grep -E "ba?g" repeat.txt`: Uses extended wildcards, requiring `-E`.
- `egrep "ba?g" repeat.txt`: Same function as above.
- `+`: Matches 1 or more occurrences of the previous characters.

- **Exact Occurrences:** Use `{}` for exact occurrences of a character.
- **Groups and Alternatives:**
    - `[]`: Matches a single occurrence of any character within brackets.
    - `()`: Groups characters for combined matching.
    - `|`: Functions as an OR operator.
