    - The size of a `task_struct` can range from 4 to 5 KB or more.
    - Knowing about `task_struct` and its role in PCB creation is useful as general knowledge.

### **OS Data Structures for Process Management:**

1. **Job Queue (Process List):**
    
    - Contains all the processes currently loaded in memory (RAM).
2. **Ready Queue:**
    
    - Contains all processes that are ready for execution.
3. **Waiting Queues:**
    
    - Contains processes that are waiting after being interrupted.
    - There are **multiple waiting queues** for various devices, whereas there is only **one job queue** and **one ready queue**.
    - Each device (e.g., printer) has its own waiting queue. When a task for a device is completed, the next process from that device's waiting queue is executed.
