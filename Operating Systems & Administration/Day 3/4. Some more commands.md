#### **1. Head and Tail Commands:**

- **`head`**: Displays the first part of files.
        `head -5 filename.txt`
        
	- This command prints the first 5 lines of `filename.txt`.
	- You can also use negative numbers with `head`, but this feature might vary based on the implementation.

- **`tail`**: Displays the last part of files.
    
    - **Example**:
        `tail +5 filename.txt`
        
	- This command starts printing from the **5th line** onward to the end of `filename.txt`.
	- Unlike `head`, `tail` does not accept negative numbers.

#### **2. Echo Command:**

- **`echo`**: Used to display messages or output text to the console.
    - **Example**:
        `echo "Hello Ojas"`
        - This command prints `Hello Ojas` on the console.

#### **3. Translate Command (tr):**

- **`tr`**: Used to translate or delete characters.
    - **Examples**:
        - **Translate space to `#`**:
            `echo "text with spaces" | tr ' ' '#'`
            
            - This replaces spaces with `#`.
			
        - **Squeeze multiple spaces into one**:
            `echo "text    with   multiple    spaces" | tr -s ' '`
            
            - This command condenses consecutive spaces into a single space.
        - **Change case**:
            `echo "Hello World" | tr 'A-Z' 'a-z'`
            
            - This converts uppercase letters to lowercase.

---

#### **4. Cut Command:**

- **`cut`**: Used to remove sections from each line of files.
    - **Example**:
        `cut -d ',' -f 1 filename.csv`
        
        - This command cuts and displays the first field (column) from a CSV file, using a comma as the delimiter.
        - You can also specify ranges:
		`cut -d ',' -f 1-3 filename.csv`
		
		- This would cut and display fields 1 through 3.

### **Meta-characters/Wildcards in Shell:**

1. **`*`**: Represents all characters.
2. **`?`**: Represents a single occurrence of any character.
3. **`;`**: Used to separate multiple commands on a single line.

### **Changing Permissions with chmod:**

- **`chmod`**: Changes the file permissions (also called access or mode).
    
    - **Examples**:
        - **Add write permission**:
            `chmod +w filename.txt`
            
        - **Add execute permission for all**:
            `chmod +x filename.txt`
            
- **Setting permissions using user types**:
    
    - `u`: User
    - `g`: Group
    - `o`: Others
    - **Example**:
        `chmod u+x,g-w filename.txt`
        
- **Octal Notation**: Permissions can also be changed using octal numbers.
    
    - For example, if the original permissions are `rw- rw- r--`, the octal number would be `664`.
    - You can set this using:
        `chmod 664 filename.txt`
        

#### **Why Are Permissions Required?**

Permissions ensure that only authorized users can read, write, or execute files, providing security and access control.

### **Changing File Ownership with chown:**

- **`chown`**: Changes the ownership of a file.
    
    - **Example**:
        `chown username filename.txt`
        
- **Change group ownership**:
    
    - **Example**:
        `chown :groupname filename.txt`
        
- **Change both owner and group**:
    
    - **Example**:
        `chown username:groupname filename.txt`
        
- To change ownership of a directory and all its sub-directories, use `-R` (recursive):
    `chown -R username directoryname/`
    

---

### **Find Command:**

- **`find`**: Searches for files in a directory hierarchy.
    - **Search by name**:
        `find -name test.txt`
        
    - **Search by exact path**:
        `find /home/sunbeam -name test.txt`
        
    - **Search by file type**:
        - Simple files:
            `find -type f`
            
        - Directories:
            `find -type d`
            
    - **Search by size**:
        `find . -size +1M`
        
        - This searches for files larger than 1 MB in the current directory.
