#### **What is Security?**

- Security ensures the **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad)** of data.
- In general, security represents a state of well-being and feeling safe from harm.

### **CIA Triad: The Pillars of Security**

1. **Confidentiality**:
    
    - Ensures data is accessible **only to authorized users**.
    - Achieved through **authentication methods** like biometrics, passwords, or OTPs.
    - **Authentication vs. Authorization**:
        - **Authentication**: Verifies if the user is legitimate.
        - **Authorization**: Verifies if the user has permission to access specific resources (e.g., Linux file permissions, sticky bits).
2. **Integrity**:
    
    - Ensures that data is not altered by unauthorized users.
    - Maintains the consistency and accuracy of data.
    - **Hashing**: A technique to verify data integrity using hash values.
        - **Example**: Tools like **hashcalc** calculate hash values to detect data alteration during transfer.
        - **checksum**: 
	        - A **checksum** is a value generated from data to verify its integrity.
	        - If the checksum matches at both the source and destination, the data is intact; if not, it has been altered.
1. **Availability**:
    
    - Ensures data is accessible **whenever and wherever** authorized users need it.
    - **Resilience**: Systems should perform well even under attack.
    - **Backup**: Acts as a safety net when resilience fails.

### **Non-Repudiation**

- Prevents users from denying their actions.
- Combines **authentication** and **integrity** to ensure:
    1. The identity of the user is authenticated.
    2. The integrity of the transaction is verified.

### **Types of Attacks**

1. **Network-Based Attacks**:
    - Target the network infrastructure.
    - Example: **Denial of Service (DoS) attacks**.
2. **Host-Based Attacks**:
    - Target specific devices like computers, mobiles, or laptops.
    - Examples: **Ransomware**, **I Love You Virus**.
3. **Application-Based Attacks**:
    - Target applications directly.
    - Example: **SQL Injection**.

- **Impact on the CIA Triad**:
    - Every attack affects at least one or more aspects of **Confidentiality, Integrity, or Availability**.

### **Targets of Attacks**

1. **People**: Individuals connected to an organization.
2. **Process**: Weaknesses in operational procedures.
3. **Technology**: Outdated or vulnerable systems (e.g., older versions of operating systems).

**Acronyms to Remember**:

- **CIA**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- **PPT**: People, Process, Technology
- **NHA**: Network, Host, Application

### **Startup Services**

- **Startup Services**: Services that start automatically when a machine boots.
- **Safe Mode**:
    - Starts with minimal services, bypassing startup programs.
    - Useful for identifying and preventing malicious files or viruses that auto-execute at boot.
- Use the **start** command in Windows to open default applications.

- **iknowwhatyoudownload.com**:
    - Tracks files downloaded via torrent using a public IP address.
- **archive.org**: Review how websites appeared in the past.
