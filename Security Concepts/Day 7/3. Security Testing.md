### **Core Testing Principles:**

- **CIA Triad:**
    - **Confidentiality:** Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    - **Integrity:** Ensure data remains unaltered and accurate.
    - **Availability:** Guarantee systems and data are accessible when needed.

### **What is Security Testing?**

A **systematic examination** of an organization's network, policies, and security controls to identify and address potential risks.

---

### **Types of Security Testing:**

#### **1. Audit**

- **Purpose:** Verify compliance with policies, standards, and regulations.
- **Key Features:**
    - Checklist-based, generally non-technical.
    - Examples:
        - ISO 27001 compliance: Employee background verification.
        - Antivirus installation requirements.
    - Auditors may request **logs and evidence** for validation.
- **Misconception:** Audit is not about identifying vulnerabilities but ensuring compliance with predefined standards.

---

#### **2. Vulnerability Assessment (VA)**

- **Purpose:** Identify weaknesses/vulnerabilities in the system.
- **Key Features:**
    - Diagnoses problems and uncovers vulnerabilities.
    - Focus areas: Web/mobile applications, networks, operating systems.
    - **Main Objective:** Identify security weaknesses.
    - Example: Finding outdated software or exposed APIs.

---

#### **3. Penetration Testing (PT)**

- **Purpose:** Exploit identified vulnerabilities to demonstrate risks.
- **Key Features:**
    - Conduct simulated attacks in a controlled environment.
    - Proves the seriousness of vulnerabilities to stakeholders.
    - Helps organizations prioritize patching to mitigate risks.
    - Without identifying vulnerabilities, PT cannot be performed.
- **Potential Risks of Ignoring Vulnerabilities:**
    - Revenue loss.
    - Reputation damage.
    - Government fines and penalties.
    - Legal challenges.
    - Customer dissatisfaction.

### **Key Components of Security Testing:**

- **People, Process, and Technology:** All three play a crucial role in securing systems.

---

### **Example Scenario:**

- **Scenario:** Sunbeam wants to identify weaknesses in their security system.
- **Action Plan:**
    - Engage vendors offering security testing services.
    - Vendors provide a questionnaire to gather details about the organization's infrastructure and applications.

---

### **Scoping Questionnaire:**

- **Purpose:** To gather information for security testing.
- **Sample Questions:**
    1. How many servers are deployed?
    2. What are the key modules and functionalities of the system?
    3. What levels of users interact with the system?
    4. What technologies are used?
