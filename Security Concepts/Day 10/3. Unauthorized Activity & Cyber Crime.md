### Legal Framework

- **Law is supreme**:  
    No one is above the law, not even the Prime Minister or President.  
    Everyone must abide by the law.
    
- **Three Pillars of Law Enforcement**:
    
    1. **Governance**
    2. **Law Enforcement Agencies**
    3. **Judiciary System**

If any of these pillars fail, citizens of the country are affected.
