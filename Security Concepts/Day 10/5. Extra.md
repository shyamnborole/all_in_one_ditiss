### **DNS Resolution Issue and Fix**

If you can **ping 8.8.8.8** (Google's DNS) but cannot access **[www.google.com](http://www.google.com/)**, your system's **name resolution** is likely the issue. Here’s how to fix it:

1. **Check `/etc/resolv.conf`**:
    
    - Open the file to verify if the nameserver is configured correctly.
    - If not, you can manually add a nameserver.
2. **Add a new nameserver**:
    
    - Open `/etc/resolv.conf` and add the following entry:
        
        ```bash
        nameserver 8.8.8.8
        ```

This should resolve the issue and allow you to access websites by name.
