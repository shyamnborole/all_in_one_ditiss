### **1. XSS (DOM-Based)**

- **What is it?**
    
    - DOM-Based XSS, also called **Type-0 XSS**, occurs when the malicious script is executed directly in the browser through client-side JavaScript.
    - The attack exploits the DOM (Document Object Model) without involving the server.
- **How to perform in DVWA?**
    
    - Navigate to the **DOM XSS** section in DVWA.
    - Enter a script payload (e.g., `<script>alert('DOM XSS');</script>`) in input fields or URL parameters.
    - The script will execute if the application improperly handles client-side input.

### **2. XSS (Reflected)**

- **What is it?**
    
    - Reflected XSS happens when user input is immediately included in the response from the server and executed in the victim's browser.
    - The malicious payload is typically delivered via URLs, emails, or search boxes.
- **How to perform in DVWA?**
    
    - Go to the **Reflected XSS** section.
    - Input a payload like `<script>alert('Reflected XSS');</script>` in any input field (e.g., search or name fields).
    - If vulnerable, the browser will execute the script.

### **3. XSS (Stored)**

- **What is it?**
    
    - Stored XSS occurs when the malicious script is permanently stored on the server (e.g., in a database, message board, or comments).
    - The script executes whenever a user accesses the infected resource.
- **How to perform in DVWA?**
    
    - Open the **Stored XSS** section.
    - Submit a payload like `<script>alert('Stored XSS');</script>` in a form (e.g., a comment box).
    - When the data is retrieved and displayed to users, the script will execute.

### **Key Points**

|Type|Characteristics|Delivery Method|
|---|---|---|
|**DOM-Based**|Executes entirely in the browser.|URL or client-side scripts.|
|**Reflected**|Immediate response from the server.|URL or form submission.|
|**Stored**|Script is saved on the server.|Persistent forms or fields.|
