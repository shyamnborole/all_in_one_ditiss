### **MAC Flooding**

- **What is it?**  
    MAC Flooding is a **Layer 2 attack** that targets switches in a local area network (LAN). The attacker floods the switch with a large number of **fake MAC addresses**, overwhelming the **Content Addressable Memory (CAM) table** of the switch. Once the CAM table is full, the switch is unable to correctly forward packets based on MAC addresses and starts broadcasting them to all ports, leading to network instability and potential packet sniffing.
    
- **CAM Table**  
    A switch uses the **CAM table** to map MAC addresses to specific ports. When the table gets full, the switch can no longer efficiently route traffic to the correct destination.

### **Practical Consideration**

- **Prerequisite**: For MAC flooding attacks, you must be connected to the network via an **Ethernet cable**.

### **Commands for MAC Flooding**

1. **Check if `macof` tool is installed**:
    
    ```bash
    which macof
    ```
    
2. **Get information about the `macof` tool**:
    
    ```bash
    whatis macof
    ```
    
3. **Flood the switch with random MAC addresses**:
    
    ```bash
    sudo macof -i eth0
    ```
    
    - This command will generate random MAC addresses and flood the switch on the `eth0` interface, filling up the CAM table and causing disruption.

### **Impact of MAC Flooding**

- **MAC Table Overload**: The switch cannot differentiate between legitimate MAC addresses and the spoofed ones, causing it to broadcast packets to all devices, leading to:
    - **Network congestion**.
    - **Man-in-the-middle (MITM)** attacks, where an attacker can capture and manipulate the traffic intended for other devices.

### **Layer 1 Attacks**

1. **Cutting Cables**: Physically disconnecting cables to cause a denial of service in the network.
2. **Creating a Loop**: Connecting LAN cables in a loop to generate broadcast storms, which can overwhelm the switch or network devices, leading to network downtime.
