1. **Ping Behavior in NAT Mode:**
    - VMs typically **cannot ping each other** because NAT mode isolates them from each other unless a private network is set up or port forwarding is configured.
    - The **Base Machine (Host)** can only interact directly with VMs if specific rules are configured, which usually isn't the case in basic NAT.
2. **Internet Access:**
    - All VMs should have internet access via NAT, as traffic is routed through the host's network adapter.
